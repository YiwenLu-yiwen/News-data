media giant TimeWarner jumped 76% to $1.13bn (\u00a3600m) for the three months to December, from $639m year-earlier.However, the company said AOL's underlying profit before exceptional items rose 8% on the back of stronger internet advertising revenues.Its profits were buoyed by one-off gains which offset a profit dip at Warner Bros, and less users for AOL.For 2005, TimeWarner is projecting operating earnings growth of around 5%, and also expects higher revenue and wider profit margins.It lost 464,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter profits were lower than in the preceding three

Reserve head said the US trade deficit is set to stabilise.China's currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency's sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive.Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months.\"I think the chairman's taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he's taken for some time,\" said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York.The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US's yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments.\"He's taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.\"", "Yukos' owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.State-owned Rosneft bought the Yugansk unit for $9.3bn in a sale forced by Russia to part settle a $27.5bn tax claim against Yukos.The sale went ahead in December and Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft.But the company has said it intends to take action against Menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by Yugansk.\"The pledged assets are with Rosneft, so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of Yugansk assets,\" said Moscow-based US lawyer Jamie Firestone, who is not connected to the case.", "Rod Eddington, BA's chief executive, said the results were \"respectable\" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by \u00a3106m or 47.3%.To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue.\"It is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong,\" he said.Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA's estimated annual surcharge revenues - \u00a3160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra \u00a3250m.\"For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,\" BA chairman Martin Broughton said.Looking ahead to its full year results to March 2005, BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers.BA's profits were still better than market expectation of \u00a359m, and it expects a rise in full-year

firm Allied Domecq have risen on speculation that it could be the target of a takeover by France's Pernod Ricard.Pernod said it was seeking acquisitions but refused to comment on specifics.In terms of market value, Pernod - at 7.5bn euros ($9.7bn) - is about 9% smaller than Allied Domecq, which has a capitalisation of \u00a35.7bn ($10.7bn; 8.2bn euros).Allied Domecq shares in London rose 4% by 1200

growth in jobs in the US economy in his first term in office.Analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions.The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.The US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.\"The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth,\" said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics.He presided over a net fall in jobs up

subsidies and direct the money into aid programmes for the poor.Indonesia's previous government, led by President Megawati Sukarnoputri, also attempted to cut subsidies in 2003, but was forced to back down in the face of public protests.But critics argue cutting subsidies will hurt the poorer families that his government says it wants to help.", "Struggling Japanese car maker Mitsubishi Motors has

passengers - 1.5bn euros, that's over \u00a31bn a year loaded onto European passengers,\" Mr Clarke said.When this happens against a passenger's will, airlines will now have to offer compensation.All EU-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the EU will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on Thursday.The EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights.Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.Air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation.However, only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations.Low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket.The EC has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights.New technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added.", "The breakneck pace of economic

big differences in wait time and call resolution\" between call centres based in Europe or North America and those in developing countries around the world.Customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests.Suggestions that \"outsourcing\" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like India or South Africa - is to blame are wrong, Ms Diemont says.The surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres' growing range of tasks.What are your experiences with call centres?However, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls, she says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year.The survey was conducted by Sunovate on behalf of

set up new businesses and emerge from their debts, a situation that is hampering Italy's entrepreneurial spirit.Without a pick up in national growth, they say, the money could eventually run out, bringing Italy's economy to a juddering halt.Mr Berlusconi has previously promised to cut taxes by 6.5bn euros ($8.6bn; \u00a34.5bn) this year in an effort to get people and companies to spend.Mr Berlusconi is expected to table reforms aimed at boosting research and development (R&D) spending, and the competitiveness of small firms.At the same time, business and consumer confidence has dipped

US subsidiary.Yukos chief financial officer Bruce Misamore, who had moved to the US in early December to set up Yukos USA, acknowledged the point.Deutsche Bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by Yukos.Yukos maintains that it filed for bankruptcy in the US because it feared it would not be able to do so in Russia.It had agreed to loan to an arm of Russian state gas firm

illegal.The Russian government's argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit's full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards.The majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (\u00a315.2bn).While Russia has signed the Charter, it has never ratified it - which some experts say could make it difficult for Menatep to press its case.Mr Khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of Menatep.The Kremlin last year seized and sold Yukos' main

bought last year.Gazprom chief Alexei Miller confirmed Rosneft-owned Yugansk was not part of the deal and will instead be spun off.Speaking on NTV television, which is controlled by Gazprom, Mr Miller added that Yugansk, which was swallowed up by Rosneft late last year, will operate as a separate, state-owned oil firm headed by current Rosneft chief Sergei Bogdanchikov.\"Ultimately and industrially, Gazprom needs Yugansk,\" he added.But he said the latest development was simply an interim step to allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom.The merger, backed by Russian authorities, will allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom shares.The state wanted to control Gazprom before allowing foreigners to trade.Analysts said the deal would give Gazprom control of 8% of Russia's total oil production, an improvement on its current 2.5%, but still far less than the 20% share it would have gained had it also taken over Yugansk.Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company in a disputed

to have been produced for about 6,000 years.But critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term, with the cheese produced widely outside Greece.Denmark is Europe's second largest producer of feta after Greece - producing about 30,000 tonnes a year - and exports its products to Greece.The Danish and German governments are challenging a European Commission ruling which said Greece should have

Tymoshenko said prosecutors had drawn up a list of more than 3,000 businesses which were to be reviewed.The list \"will be limited and final, and will not be extended after its completion\", he said.The privatisation review's number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included Viktor Pinchuk, Mr Kuchma's son-in-law, for $800m (\u00a3424m) despite higher bids from several

after cold weather on both sides of the North Atlantic pushed US crude prices to four-month highs.Declines in the dollar have also contributed to the rising oil price.Several Opec members said on Tuesday that a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia.Expectations that a rebound in the dollar would halt the oil price rise were not immediately borne out on Wednesday morning, as oil prices carried on upwards as the dollar strengthened against the euro, the pound and the yen.Freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls took crude oil prices past

rise was \"uncharted territory\", adding that the steel industry \"hasn't seen an increase of this magnitude probably in 50 years\".Steel prices rose by 8% globally in January alone and by 24% in

narrowed down to 14 key indicators, with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth.\"Lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing,\" the Kok report said.Mr Kok was commissioned by the European Commission in March this year to assess how far the EU has come towards meeting the Lisbon targets, five years on from their inception.But the Lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige.But some analysts believe that the Kok report doesn't come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the Lisbon targets a reality.The economic targets set out at the Lisbon summit of European Union leaders in 2000 were meant to help Europe leapfrog its way past the United States to become the world's leading economy by 2010.\"The [Lisbon] vision is a compelling one, but in order to do it society has to change,\" said Paul Hofheinz of the Lisbon Council, a Brussels-based citizen action group.On one point Mr Kok was very clear: The European Union should not try to emulate the US economy.But part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in Lisbon five years ago.But meeting the Lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no EU member state has volunteered so far.The Kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth.The European economic and social model needs to change, but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth.Lisbon risks becoming a \"synonym for missed objectives and failed promises\", his report said.Targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the Lisbon case, they covered too much, according to the Wim report.\"The US suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the European economy followed suit.\"As Mr Kok's report noted: \"The ink had scarcely dried on the [Lisbon] agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded.\"The circumstances weren't conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by EU leaders in Lisbon in 2000.The EU's economic growth rate is projected to be 2% this year and 2.4% next.For many economists and analysts they

production of Saabs to the US, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car.As part of its efforts to make the US marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine.Neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, since it reflects Saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market.\"We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is today,\" the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News.General Motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden.The car, unveiled at the Geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market.Other luxury car makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe.It will not be sold in the US, said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster.Bringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year.GM's plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers.Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar, which is making Saabs more expensive to US consumers.It follows a similar initiative by GM in the US.", "Shares in Elan and Biogen Idec plunged on Monday as the firms suspended

forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual \u00a310.5bn \"black hole\" in the nation's coffers.The changes by the ONS increase the current budget measure for the past five years by \u00a32.1bn in total.But the Treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions.Correcting the error would mean

up to $20bn in oil and gas projects.On the agenda are oil and gas extraction as well as transportation deals, to be led by Russian energy giant Gazprom and India's ONGC.Russian news agencies reported that India's petroleum minister Mr Aiyar and Russian energy minister Viktor Khristenko would discuss the future of Yugansk at a meeting on Tuesday.ONGC could invest in gas and oil fields in Sakhalin, in the far east of Russia, and may also take part in joint tender bids for projects in eastern Siberia and the Caspian Sea.The agreement is likely to see the two companies develop refining facilities in Russia, India and elsewhere and organise delivery of oil, gas and petrochemicals from Russia to India and other countries across Asia.India is urgently searching for fresh energy supplies -

in Germany, especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem.That is one reason why people here are not great fans of the EU, says Frederic Sawicki, a politics lecturer at the

peso will from 8 November be subject to a 10% tax.It has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the government's economic problems.Cubans living in the US are now limited to one visit to Cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives.Cuban citizens, who receive money from overseas, and foreign visitors, who change dollars in Cuba, will be affected.Mr Barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity.President Bush's government, which has been a strong supporter of the 40-year-old trade

massive budget deficit increases of President Bush's first term.The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, increased expenditure on national security after 9/11 and the 2001 recession wiped out the budget surplus inherited by President Bush in 2001 and turned it into a record deficit.Vice-President Dick Cheney said the budget was the \"tightest\" so far.Defence spending will rise, however, while the

applies to firms with more than 300 US shareholders, a situation many firms without US listings could find themselves in.It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.The US stock market watchdog's chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new US corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms.The SEC has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including US ones - with market capitalisations below $700m (\u00a3374m).Mr Donaldson said the SEC would \"consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process\" for foreign firms unwilling to meet US requirements.The US regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing.European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly.Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US listings.Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would \"continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate

spending cuts, but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs.Without major changes in current policies and political prejudices, the federal budget simply cannot hold together.The budget proposals laid out by the administration of US President George W Bush are highly controversial.Federal revenues are at 1950s levels, while spending remains where it has been in recent decades - much higher.Indeed, if Congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way, there would hardly be any such spending left.The US Government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of Japan and China, among other nations.One thing is certain - destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the US economy and government for the challenges of this new century.This upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government, putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business.Reducing domestic spending, or eliminating \"waste, fraud and abuse\" is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem.The biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security), and health care for the elderly and the poor.Savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system, public and private.Even now, a growing share of US borrowing is from abroad.US politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy.Under direct threat will be the federal government's ability to make good on its debts to the Social Security Trust Fund.By definition, the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending - but this neutral description doesn't adequately capture the current situation.The trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt, which will grow in 10 years, by conservative estimates, to more than half the nation's total annual output.From the standpoint of the big fiscal trends, the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come.The US population is aging, and the nation does face genuine threats

does not include the cost of running military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, for which the administration is expected to seek an extra $80bn from Congress later this year.The state department's

risen on speculation that it is in takeover talks.The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Qwest has bid $6.3bn (\u00a33.4bn) for MCI.Shares in MCI, which changed its name from Worldcom when it emerged from bankruptcy, were up 2.4% at $20.15.Competition has intensified and fixed-line phone providers such as MCI and AT&T have seen themselves overtaken by rivals.Buying MCI would give Qwest, a local phone service provider, access to MCI's global network and business-based subscribers.The largest US telephone company Verizon has previously held preliminary merger discussions with MCI, Reuters quoted sources as saying.Other firms have also expressed an interest in MCI, the second-largest US long-distance phone firm, and may now table rival bids, analysts said.", "\"Central to the proposals are plans by BT to offer operators lower wholesale prices, faster broadband services and transparent, highly-regulated access to BT's local network,\" the former monopoly said in a statement.\"This is a reminder to Ofcom that as long as BT can change the dynamics of the whole broadband market at will, the process of opening up the UK's local telephone network to infrastructure investment and competition remains fragile,\" a spokesman said.\"The United Kingdom has the opportunity to create the most exciting and innovative telecoms market in the world,\" BT chief executive Ben Verwaayen said.\"BT has a critical role to play, and today we are making a set of far-reaching proposals towards that framework,\" he said.The move comes after telecom regulator Ofcom said in November that the firm must offer competitors \"real equality of access to its phone lines\".BT has moved to pre-empt a possible break-up of its business by offering to cut wholesale broadband prices and open its network to rivals.\"I think it's the first productive thing we've had from BT,\" he said.To meet the growing demand for greater bandwidth, BT said it would begin trials in April with a view to launching higher-speed services nationally from the autumn.\"The big question now is whether the industry, and particularly Ofcom feels BT's proposals go far enough ...Now the real negotiation begins,\" director of telecoms research Tony Lavender said.\"BT has been challenged to play fair and its plans will introduce a level playing field.The scenario now is how well people execute their

down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.The US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three

eyeing a move into the video games market.France's Ubisoft, one of Europe's biggest video game publishers, has been trying to remain independent since Electronic Arts announced plans to buy 19.9% of

economic growth, according to a government spokesman.\"Our nation is in peril here,\" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman.Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the

minister Sontaya Kunplome.\"Calculators will have to wait,\" said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday.However, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact.", "Stock markets in Indonesia and India have hit all-time highs this week; even in Sri Lanka, more comprehensively affected, the main index has lost only 5% since the waves hit.Second, stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged.The MSCI World share index, a measure of global stock market performance, hit its highest level this week since early 2001; the BBC Global 30 has risen by 3% in the past week.Even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market - currently $30 trillion and rising.And where insurance certainly is in place - in, for example, the many tourist complexes affected - the costs will be borne in far-away corners of the global reinsurance market, rather than landing locally.The trillion-dollar debts of Japan's banks, for example, have had no effect on stock markets further afield than Tokyo.But disasters have a vast psychological impact, and markets are driven by psychological factors.In fact, the markets are being perfectly rational.And indeed, stock exchange traders around Asia have wasted little time regretting the victims of this week's disaster.Asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies, many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities.A study of the 1993 Des Moines floods, from the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware*, found that 70% of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster, and another 18% felt themselves better off.Bigger markets further afield have barely twitched.And the US stock market was on its way down long before 11 September, 2001; it rose by 20% during the six months following the attacks.For a start, the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines.", "The unfolding scale of the disaster in south Asia had little immediate impact on US shares, however.But the disaster has little impact on stock markets in the US and Asia.Shares in Munich Re and Swiss Re - the world's two biggest reinsurers - both fell

difficult to predict the total cost of the disaster and warned that share prices and currencies would come under increasing pressure as the bills mounted.Shares in Europe's leading reinsurers and travel firms have fallen as the scale of the damage wrought by tsunamis across south Asia has become apparent.The Thai baht lost 0.3% against the US currency, trading at 39.10.Shares fell just 0.03%.Investors pointed out, however, that declines probably would be industry specific, with the travel and insurance firms hit hardest.However, the overall impact on Asia's largest stock market, Japan's Nikkei, was slight.Reisurance firms such as Swiss Re and Munich Re lost value as investors worried about rebuilding costs.Travel companies also took a hit, with Japan's Kinki Nippon sliding 1.5% and HIS dropping 3.3%.Insurers and reinsurance firms were also under pressure in Europe.Germany's benchmark Dax index closed the day 16.29 points lower at 3.817.69 while France's Cac index of

Clara Furse the day after rival Deutsche Boerse put forward its own bid case.Commentators believe Deutsche Boerse, which has now formally asked German authorities to approve its plan to buy the LSE, may offer to sell Clearstream to gain shareholder approval.There was speculation Euronext would use Friday's meeting as an opportunity to take advantage of growing disquiet over Deutsche Boerse's own plans for dominance over the London market.Meanwhile, LSE shareholders fear that Deutsche Boerse's control over its Clearstream unit - the clearing house that processes securities transactions - would

"But it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all Russian firms, even targets of the tax police.The calculations demonstrated what many Russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal, since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable.The net result, the authors say, is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.Since then, the Russian stock market has more than trebled in value, a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach.The report highlights the case of Sibneft, a Russian oil company that came close to merging with Yukos last year.\"An increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive, even accounting for increased levels of taxation,\" the authors say.According to the authors, although a variety of changes were sweeping through Russian industry at the time, the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at Sibneft and many of its peers.Genuine, disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in Russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced.And the authors' definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically Western.The paper's reasoning is complex, and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular, the propensity of management to steal from the company.On the other hand, increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent, forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately.For all its faults, corporate Russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000.", "The owner of the technology-dominated Nasdaq stock index plans to sell

the annual \u00a31,200 limit being directed to a deposit account.As the Child Trust Fund will not be in force in time for Christmas, relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children's deposit account, and use this as a feeder fund.If the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance.Where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child, consideration should be given to opening separate accounts - one for parents' gifts and one for gifts from other relatives.Interest earned by children is subject to income tax.The tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child.There are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest.The only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18, and parents will have no control over how it is spent.This confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax.The government is trying to encourage saving at an early age, through its new Child Trust Fund.Parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to \u00a31,200 a year, which will grow free of income and capital gains tax.Only \u00a3100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free.It may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs, for example.Where interest exceeds this level, the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent.This is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children's names and taking advantage of the tax allowances.The parent or guardian will be

stocks have improved ahead of winter.The falls were triggered when the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that US crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago.However, some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden Opec's attitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output.Weak US fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices.Opec nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild US stocks hit by supply disruptions after Hurricane Ivan in September.The price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has fallen from the record of $55.67 set in late October.The price of both benchmark crudes has dropped 12% in two days.Analysts also attributed the fall to mild early-winter weather, which has tempered demand for heating oil.The long-awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth.Analysts, however, say prices will fall further if inventories continue to rise.However, traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world.", "Speaking at the Soccerex football business forum in Dubai, he said a full listing was \"one of the options\" for funding after the club moves to its new stadium.Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein has said the club may consider seeking a full listing for its shares on the London Stock Exchange.The club - which is currently listed on the smaller Ofex share exchange - is due to move into its new 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium at Ashburton Grove for the start of the 2006/07 season.The club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from 29% to 40% of turnover, and has not ruled out other money-earning means, including a full share listing.\"When the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review,\" Mr Dein said.When Arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52% this season to 34% in two years' time.The club is funding its move to Ashburton Grove through a number of sources, including debt from banks, from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors, and from the sale of surplus property, including its Highbury Stadium.Mr Dein also warned the current level of TV coverage of the Premiership may be reaching saturation level, with signs that match attendances have

under control.The Brazilian stock market has risen to a record high as investors display growing confidence in the durability of the country's economic recovery.However, Mr da Silva has stuck to an orthodox monetary policy inherited from his predecessor even in the face of last year's economic crisis.President da Silva has defended his policies, arguing that Brazil cannot afford to continue the cycle of boom and bust which afflicted it in recent decades.Economic output declined 0.2% in 2003 and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva - elected as Brazil's first working-class president in 2002 - was strongly criticised for pursuing a hardline economic policy.Analysts believe the stock market will rise above the 25,000 mark for the first time before too long.Although interest rates still stand

deficit.And Mr Greenspan said that could turn into a trend, if the fall of the dollar kept eating into the value of those investments.The slide comes as the US has been attempting to talk up the traditional \"strong dollar\" policy.\"It seems persuasive that, given the size of the US current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point,\" he said.For the US government, letting the dollar drift is a useful short-term fix.Rising oil prices and the sinking dollar hit shares on Monday after a finance ministers' meeting and stern words from Fed chief Alan Greenspan.G20 finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar, whose slide could further jeopardise growth in Japan and Europe.At present, much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to Asian states such as Japan and China, since the dollar is seen as the world's reserve currency.Similarly, Asian investment helps bridge the gap in the current account - the deficit between what the US as a whole spends and what it earns.US exports get more affordable, helping perhaps to close the trade gap.", "Google shares have risen since but fell $12.33 on Tuesday to

Planning Organisation.Critics insist that much of the optimism about Turkey's economic roadmap has been over-egged - an argument amplified by a 134% rise in the country's current account deficit to $10.7bn during the first 10 months of this year.As Turkey's gross domestic output (GDP) is set to grow by 6% per year on average, its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020.Three years after a gruelling economic crisis, Turkey has dressed its economy to impress.However, Turkey's assertions are confirmed by Brussels' own impact studies, which indeed say that Turkish membership would be good news for the EU economy.A key factor for EU decision makers should be whether or not Turkey has met its economic criteria.The point of all this has been to convince Europe's decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the EU, allowing Turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits.\"Turkey will not be a burden for the EU budget.\"The country's massive debt - which includes $23bn owed to the IMF and billions borrowed via the international bond markets - also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the EU.Costs are projected to be vast during the early years of Turkey's membership, with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 16.5bn euros and, according to some predictions, balloon to 33.5bn euros.\"At about 80% of GDP, Turkey's gross debt is double that figure.\"Turkey's debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the country's devastating recession.The tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to $21bn (\u00a310.8bn) in three years.\"In the new member states of the European Union, gross public debt is typically about 40% of gross domestic product,\" says Reza Moghadam, assistant director of the IMF's European Department.Such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by Turkey's government would never be delivered, say those who feel the Turkish project should be shunned.And although the state of Turkey's economy is important, as is its pace of reform, the final decision on 17 December will be taken by politicians who will, of course, be guided by their political instincts.", "US phone company SBC Communications said it

observes Ms Alexander.Yet in some areas of the economy, investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed, insists Mr Hadi, an Iraqi who left the country three decades ago.\"It is seen as a selling off of Iraq's assets and bringing in multinationals at the expense of Iraqi businesses and Iraqi workers,\" she says.The economy has become the second-most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of Sunday's election, according to Bristol University political scientist Anne Alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war Iraq.National Bank of Kuwait has bought a majority stake in Credit Bank of Iraq, the Jordanian investment bank Export & Finance Bank has bought 49% of National Bank of Iraq.Mr Hadi's Blackwatch is just one of many small operators preparing for a much bigger future.Consequently, the transitional government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over its proposal to allow 100% foreign ownership of Iraqi assets, she explains.Observes Mr Hadi: \"The economy at present marks a big divide; the rich get richer, the poor get poorer.\"Hopes are high for the future of finance, so foreign banks have been buying into the sector.\"I think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast,\" Mr Hadi says.The Iraqi business people will do business at all times.Many foreign companies say they are keen to get in on the act, yet few are actually entering the country in any meaningful way.Mr Hadi's view about what the new government's priorities should be is shared by many Iraqis.", "But the Commission report says that, in

2000, EU leaders at a summit in Lisbon pledged the European economy would outstrip that of the US by 2010.Most EU countries have failed to put in place policies aimed at making Europe the world's most

comes to longevity, Japan, as a country, appears to be doing just that.In contrast to Japan - and of course the European Union - the US population is expected to increase by 46% to 420 million by the middle of the century.\"Japan has never really liked that option in its history and I think it's an option that's becoming more and more plausible and necessary,\" insists Mr Wood.Mr Toshitsune is one of Japan's 23,000 centenarians - a club that is growing by 13% annually, and where the oldest member is 114.Come 2020, Japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power.\"Japan still has problems getting a viable banking system, let alone shifting their auto business or their semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas,\" says Mr Wood.In Japan, as in Europe which also faces a workforce decline, immigration is a very sensitive subject.Japan is the world's least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the US.At his neat Osaka detached house, where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters, Mr Toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out Buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional Japanese tea ceremony.The International Monetary Fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from 2010, the cost of running Japan's welfare state will double to more than 5% of GDP, while current account balances will deteriorate by over 2%.But unfortunately, Japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically.Japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession.Mr Toshitsune wants to outlive everyone.By 2007, Japan's population is expected to peak at 127 million, then shrink to under 100 million by the middle

organisation, the EEF, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future.\"The Bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,\" he said.The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move.\"So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,\" said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley.It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.Rates went up five times from November 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since August.Rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium.\"Interest rates are likely to remain on hold for

seek sanctions against Baikal Finance Group, the little-known firm which has bought its main asset.Yukos has said it will sue Baikal and others involved in the sale of Yuganskneftegas for $20bn in damages.Yukos' US lawyers will attempt to have Baikal assets frozen after the Russian government ignored a US court order last week blocking the sale.Yukos' US lawyers claim the auction was illegal because the firm had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were now under the protection of US bankruptcy law which has worldwide jurisdiction.Yukos has claimed that the sale of its main asset will lead to the collapse of the company.Russian newspapers have claimed that Baikal - which bought the Yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles, \u00a34.8bn) on Sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with Surgutneftegas, Russia's fourth-biggest oil producer.Many observers believe that the unit, which produces 60% of Yukos' oil output, could ultimately fall into

accounting irregularities were uncovered at the company.The problems afflicting Fannie Mae are just the latest to hit the US mortgage industry.Recent investigations have exposed extensive accounting errors at Fannie Mae, which supplies funds to America's $8 trillion mortgage market.Although not making loans directly to buyers, Fannie Mae is the largest single player in the mortgage market, underwriting half of all US house purchases.Analysts said the SEC's criticism made it impossible for Fannie Mae's senior executives to remain.Fannie Mae was found to have violated accounting rules

association that represents bank account and bond holders.Argentina was on the brink of collapse.Few people have recovered more than about half their savings, Mr Baez Silva estimated, pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government, people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe.\"Everyone needs to keep in mind the enormous cost on the part of both creditors and the Argentine society and people that will have been endured by the time a settlement is reached,\" he said.The debt default sparked a deep and prolonged economic crisis which, at least initially, was made worse by the government's decisions.Argentina has made a remarkable recovery from a hideous and lengthy recession which in 2001 culminated in the government halting debt repayments to its private creditors.\"Locally there is a sense of recovery, many companies are exporting now,\" he said, noting that a lot of firms, which were closed during the crisis, are re-opening.Argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of 2001.The affair has made Mr Baez Silva disillusioned with the country's legal system.It really was dire.The fix was found in the currency markets with the abandonment of the peso's decade-long peg to the US dollar in February 2002.\"The Argentine authorities are proud, should be proud, of the strong performance of the economy,\" Thomas Dawson, an IMF director, said earlier this month.\"Agriculture and tourism are helping,\" said

worldwide jurisdiction.Russia's president has defended the purchase of Yukos' key production unit by state-owned oil firm Rosneft, saying it followed free market principles.It has said it will be seeking damages of $20bn.The Rosneft announcement came just hours after Yukos accused Gazprom of illegally taking part in Sunday's auction.Gazprom, the company originally tipped to buy Yuganskneftegas, was banned from taking part in the auction by a US court injunction.By selling the Yukos unit to little-known Baikal and then to Rosneft, Russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines, analysts said.A Rosneft spokesman has said the acquisition is part of its plan to build a \"balanced, national energy corporation.\"Further muddying the waters is a merger between Rosneft and Gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned.\"Everything was done by market methods,\" Mr Putin said at his year-end press conference in Moscow.The latest announcement

Halifax house price data should not distract from the fact that there is a clear downward trend in house prices,\" a Capital Economics statement said.Last week, the Nationwide said that house prices fell 0.2% in December, with annual inflation running at a three year low.Martin Ellis, Halifax chief economist, said that there was no need to revise the bank's prediction, made last month, that prices would fall by 2% in 2005.The biggest decline was seen in Wales where prices fell by 6.2%, an area that had experienced strong house price growth during most of 2004.In the North West and Yorkshire and the Humber, Halifax said prices rose by 3% and 1.2% in the two regions respectively during the month.As a result, annual house price inflation dipped below 20% during the final few

acquisition in a growth market\".Some analysts also queried whether Standard Chartered had overpaid for KFB.Standard Chartered said acquiring Korea First Bank (KFB) fulfilled a strategic objective of building a bigger presence in Asia's third largest economy.Standard Chartered expects about 16% of future group revenue to come from KFB.This time around, Standard Chartered is thought to have beaten HSBC to the deal.KFB is South Korea's seventh largest bank, with 3 million retail customers, 6% of the country's banking market and an extensive branch network.Standard Chartered said it was buying 100% of KFB, an agreement that would bring an end to the bank's complex dual ownership.HSBC will now have to wait for the next South Korean bank in line to be sold off - thought likely to be Korea

firms like Yukos - a technique now being applied by the Kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake.The privatisation of companies such as Yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled, he said.Mr Gref also poured cold water on President Putin's promises of doubled economic growth within a decade.His comments follow the sale of much of oil giant Yukos to cover back taxes - a deal which effectively took most of the firm's assets into public ownership.The assault on Yukos' assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months.Yuganskneftegaz, the unit which produced 60%

analysts, the failure of talks between India and Pakistan on the Baglihar dam in Indian-administered Kashmir has not automatically led to heightened tensions.A lot of Arab money, he says, has already gone to Malaysia and Indonesia.Locally, too, say analysts, recent political developments have worked to the market's advantage.Analysts argue that a steady improvement in Pakistan's credit ratings by

sub-Saharan Africa, even in countries with an HIV prevalence of 10-19%, only around 7% of companies have formal HIV/Aids policies in place, according to the report.The WEF report concludes that businesses need to understand their exposure to HIV/Aids risks and come up with good local practices to manage them.The WEF report shows that despite the fact that 14,000 people contract HIV/Aids

Microsoft, also hopes to use Davos to shore up its defences against open source software like Linux, which threaten Microsoft's near monopoly on computer desktops.However, many of the issues discussed in Porto Alegre are Davos talking points as well.UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and South African President Thabo Mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting.Davos fans still hark back to 1994, when talks between Yassir Arafat and Mr Peres came close to a peace deal.Microsoft founder Bill Gates, the world's richest man and a regular at Davos,

Sarbanes-Oxley Act.But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing.European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly.Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US listings.Mr Donaldson said that although the Act

MPs at the 1997 general election, and greater numbers of women in the Cabinet, female MPs often say they feel stuck on the edge of a male world.This was mainly because there were more women present in Parliament who were not prepared to \"put up with\" the sexist attitudes they came across, Prof Lovenduski said.Male MPs pretended to juggle imaginary breasts and jeered \"melons\" as women made Commons speeches, researchers from Birkbeck College were told.Prof Joni Lovenduski, who conducted the study with the help of Margaret Moran MP and a team of journalists, said she was shocked at the findings.But she added: \"Some women, including the women who came in 1997, received extraordinary treatment and I am not convinced that if the number of women changed back to what it was before 1997 that things would not change back.Labour's Yvette Cooper said she found it hard to persuade Commons officials she was a minister and not a secretary.Women MPs endure \"shocking\" levels of sexist abuse at the hands of their male counterparts, a new study shows.And ex-Tory education secretary Gillian Shepherd remembered how one of her male colleagues called all women \"Betty\".Barbara Follet, one of the so-called \"Blair Babes\" elected in 1997, told researchers: \"I remember some Conservatives - whenever a Labour woman got up to speak they would take their breasts - imaginary breasts - in their hands and wiggle them and say 'melons' as we spoke.\"", "Mr Campbell messaged Newsnight after the programme investigated claims that Labour's advertising agency TBWA was blaming him for controversy over its campaign posters.Liam Fox, Tory co-chairman, said the return of Mr Campbell was a sign of new \"sinister and underhand tactics\" by Labour.The e-mail was revealed the day after Peter Mandelson, former Labour minister and now a European Commissioner, warned the BBC to steer away from \"demonising\" Mr Campbell.The e-mail was sent by mistake to Newsnight journalist Andrew McFadyen.Mr Campbell has recently re-joined Labour's election campaign.Mr Campbell sent the missive by mistake to BBC2's Newsnight after it sought to question his role in Labour's controversial poster campaign.Mr Campbell's e-mail, which was apparently intended for a party official, suggested they should get Trevor Beattie, TBWA's boss, to issue a statement.Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said he had always had \"very good and polite relations\" with Mr Campbell, who he described as \"very talented\".Ex-No 10 media chief Alastair Campbell is at the centre of a new political row over an e-mail containing a four-letter outburst aimed at BBC journalists.Realising his error, Mr Campbell then e-mailed Mr McFadyen pointing out the mistake, but suggesting presenter Jeremy Paxman would have seen

is set to be made by the Scottish Parliament.The Scottish Executive believes that the legislation should be handled by Westminster.", "Mr Howard will host a news conference at the party's London HQ every morning, Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said.On Mrs Howard's role, Mr Fox said: \"Sandra has already been campaigning with Michael on a number of visits and has been undertaking short visits herself.\"We want Michael to be as accessible as possible,\" Mr Fox said, adding that the party was not afraid of scrutiny.But Labour campaign chiefs say there are no plans for Mr Blair to hold a daily news conference.Tony Blair has also said he is intending to get out and talk to as many people as possible during the election campaign.Mrs Howard will make solo visits to target seats as well as accompanying her husband on his helicopter campaign trail criss-crossing the country.The Tory leader wanted to meet as many ordinary members of the public, Mr Fox said.", "However, one of the so-called Guildford Four, Gerry Conlon - who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs - said the families were delighted with the apology.In a statement recorded for television, Mr Blair said the families deserved \"to be completely and publicly exonerated\".He made the apology to members of the Conlon and Maguire families in his private room at Westminster.Mrs Maguire was the relative with whom Giuseppe planned to stay in London, as well as two family friends.Also arrested were Anne Maguire and members of her family.She said it was a \"wonderful feeling\" to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.The families had hoped the apology would be made during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons.He said Mr Blair had spoken with \"such sincerity\", adding: \"He went beyond what we thought he would, he took time to listen to everyone.Mr Conlon's father Giuseppe was arrested when travelling to London from Belfast to help his son.Mr Blair said: \"I am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice.\"", "Former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke says Mr Howard has a bigger problem changing perceptions of the Tory party than his personal image.Ms Robinson, a friend of the Tory leader, also revealed that as a Cambridge student Mr Howard was \"much loved by women and he was a courteous and kind and rather dashing lover\" - although she denied having personal experience.Mr Howard, whose parents fled the Nazi threat to come to the UK, says the claim would mean no-one from an immigrant family could become premier.Documentary maker Michael Cockerell was given behind-the-scenes access to Mr Howard for his film portrait.The Tory leader was asked about to respond to people who said that if there had there been a quota on immigration and asylum in the 1930s, his parents might not have been allowed into the country.Tory leader Michael Howard has gone on the offensive in response to people questioning how a son of immigrants can propose asylum quotas.- Michael Howard: No More Mr Nasty is being shown on BBC2 on Saturday 12 February at 2005 GMT.The Tory leader brands such criticisms as \"absolutely rubbish\", arguing that he has been consistent on his support for the war but critical of Mr Blair's failure to tell the truth on intelligence.He says Tony Blair was not worried by his opponents' early performance in their Commons clashes because Mr Howard lacked a \"big strategy\", including on issues like Iraq.The film shows Mr Howard laughing at Rory Bremner's impression of him as Dracula, which he calls \"good fun\", apart from the serious falsehood of a comment suggesting he wants fewer black people in the UK.", "Mr Blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable.Mr Blair said the bill, which brings in house arrest for terror suspects, had time limiting safeguards already.In the Commons, Mr Howard said it would be \"far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so Parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through\".The Tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the Anti-Terrorism Bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in November.He said if someone was wrongly given a control order it would act as a \"recruiting sergeant\" for terrorists.The Lib Dems plan to oppose the Bill in the Lords on Thursday.The bill proposes \"control orders\", which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use.I would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months.\"The Tories want judicial oversight of all control orders, not just house arrest.He went on to say: \"If we don't get the amendments we regard as essential, including the sunset clause, we will vote against the bill.\"", "Gibraltarians rejected plans for the Rock's sovereignty to be shared between Britain and Spain in a referendum organised by Gibraltar government.Most Gibraltarians said in a referendum they wanted to remain British.In October, Mr

Auschwitz for the commemoration of the Soviets' 1945 liberation of the camp.Between 1.1 and 1.5 million people, mainly Jews, were killed at Auschwitz.Altogether, some six million people, mainly Jews, perished in the Holocaust.", "But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were \"a recognition that people will get drunk\".Mr MacDonell said: \"I think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking.Mr MacDonell, political editor of The Scotsman, said: \"I think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill-advised remark by the first minister.Mr MacDonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were \"off the mark\", they were bound to \"come back and bite him\".He added: \"Here, Mr McConnell was talking in the Highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the Scottish Executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters.He said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk.The media attention had helped to move the focus from Scotland's binge drinking problems, Mr Law said.The one-sentence comment was immediately criticised by the Scottish National Party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk.Mr McConnell was speaking on Monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions.He said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink.Mr Law added: \"I think the remark was ill-advised - but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in Scotland.", "But the government was said to be still rewriting its response on Friday.He is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week.Final appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for England's secondary schools put forward by the Tomlinson report.\"It will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response,\" said the chairman of the Commons education select committee, Labour MP Barry Sheerman.His main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications.The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has also told the government not to \"compromise\".Sir Mike Tomlinson himself was briefed only this week.It has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms' concerns on this score.But people understand that a White Paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the Department for Education and Skills.The chief inspector of schools, David Bell, also said recently that GCSEs and A-levels should go.", "Mr Blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the \"cornerstone\" of Labour's programme.Mr Brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.Mr Brown insisted his spending plans were \"affordable\" and he could afford to be optimistic because Britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising.All of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all,\" Mr Blair said.In his pre-Budget report, Mr Brown surprised some City experts by forecasting UK growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year.In a speech at Edinburgh's Napier University, he said Labour would publish over the next few months \"a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term\".\"It is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending,\" Mr Cable told MPs.Tony Blair has backed Chancellor Gordon Brown's pre-Budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the UK economy.Conservative Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: \"I can't find a single economic forecaster from the IMF to the Institute of Fiscal Studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances.", "Tony Blair has said he does not want higher tax rates for top earners but on Wednesday said other tax promises would be left to Labour's manifesto.He attacked Tory plans to process asylum claims abroad - but Mr Howard said Labour had proposed the idea too.It was no good Mr Blair claiming tax pledges were being left to the manifesto as he had given one to MPs on Tuesday about the top rate of income tax, argued Mr Howard.Prime minister's questions also saw Mr Blair predict that new plans would probably cut net immigration.Mr Howard read from a letter about the government's own plans at the European Council of Ministers for processing asylum seekers outside the EU.Pointing to national insurance, he added: \"Everyone knows tax will go up under Labour: isn't it now clear which tax it would be?\"Mr Blair said abuses would be weeded out and chain migration, where families automatically get the right to settle with immigrant workers, would end.Mr Howard pointed to the Institute for Fiscal Studies' predictions that Labour will need to increase taxes to cover an \u00a311bn gap in its spending plans.", "Committee chairman Barry Sheerman said: \"UK e-University was a terrible waste of public money.The e-University was scrapped last year, having attracted only 900 students at a cost of \u00a350m.The Commons education select committee called this \"morally indefensible\" but the government said the e-University project had \"improved understanding\".With no significant private investors and no direct accountability to a government minister, the e-University had had \"too much freedom to spend public money as it wished\", the report found.The report warns that the government should not be scared off investment in innovative but potentially risky schemes by the failure of the e-University, but \"should learn the lessons from this disaster\".She added: \"UK e-Universities was not the only organisation to have lost out on private sector investment in the collapse of the

looked at the figures, published them, and was independent of government.Barbara Roche said an organisation should monitor and publish figures and be independent of government.", "The Commission for Africa's report will be released on 11 March - Comic Relief day, Tony Blair has said.As well as more aid, fairer trade and less debt, the commission is likely to demand action on corruption in Africa.Bob Geldof, in characteristically blunt style, promised that the commission would not just be a talking shop but would deliver radical new thinking to change direction for Africa.Mr Blair has vowed to put Africa at the top of his agenda during his time at the helm of the G8.The former rock star's presence on the commission has been interpreted as a sign that it will be uncompromising in its demands.", "Liberal Democrat deputy leader Menzies Campbell said he thought Lord Butler's comments were \"well justified\" and Mr Blair's style of leadership was \"corrosive of the whole system of government\".Lord Butler's assessment was backed by his predecessor as Cabinet Secretary, Lord Armstrong.Lord Butler said the government had too much freedom to \"bring in bad Bills\" and \"to do whatever it likes\" and it relied too much on the advice of political appointees.Asked why he thought the warnings were not there Lord Butler said: \"One has got to remember what the purpose of the dossier was.Lord Butler said Mr Blair bypassed the Cabinet and relied instead on small, informal groups of advisers to help him make decisions.Tory leader Michael Howard said Lord Butler had given the \"most damaging testimony\" he could remember.The reason for this is that it would have weakened ministers' case for war, Lord Butler said in his Spectator interview, which was conducted by the magazine's editor, Conservative MP Boris Johnson.The purpose of the dossier was to persuade the British why the government thought Iraq was a very serious threat.\"\"This is from someone who was an insider at the very heart of the Blair government.But Labour former minister Jack Cunningham accused Lord Butler of basing his comments on the first eight months of the incoming Labour administration, when he was cabinet secretary.Lord Butler's report earlier this year into Iraq intelligence said the government's September 2002 weapons dossier did not make clear intelligence about claims that Saddam Hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons was \"very thin\".Mr Howard described Lord Butler's intervention as \"very important\".", "But Lib Dem officials say Mr Oaten was speaking when an inquiry was under way and was avoiding rushing to judgement.Lib Dem spokesman Mark Oaten said the number of officials who had forgotten what happened was worrying.Mr Oaten said people would be mystified why Sir Alan's inquiry failed to uncover why processing of the visa application was speeded up.The Tories criticised the Lib Dem stance, saying Mr Oaten had initially said he accepted Mr Blunkett's word unless further evidence emerged.He said: \"There is a strong case for a judge-led judicial review of this because, of course, next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa.", "Nine overseas embassies and high commissions will close in an effort to save money, UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has announced.In a written statement, Mr Straw said: \"The savings made will help to underpin higher priority work in line with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's strategic priorities, including counter- proliferation, counter-terrorism, energy and climate

opened.Other diplomatic posts are being turned over to local staff.\"But the government must give a far clearer reason for making the dramatic changes it has announced and must show that British commercial interests and the interests of Britons abroad will not be adversely affected,\" he said.Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said there was a constant need to ensure value for money from foreign missions.The changes are due to be put in place before the end of 2006, with most savings made from cutting staff and running costs.", "\"It is clear form these figures that schools and local education authorities are now seizing the tools we have given them to improve school attendance and crack down hard on the very small numbers of pupils which account for almost half of the nation's

to official statistics.In one local education authority alone 800 parents were warned they would receive a penalty notice unless their child's attendance improved.Held twice each year, in addition to routine local patrols, previous country-wide sweeps have apprehended 31,000 pupils dodging school.A Department for Education and Skills source said: \"Every day in school counts.Tories say Labour's previous success regarding the issue came because it tackled the easy part of the problem by reducing authorised absence, where parents are permitted to take children out of school.Truancy has been reduced by 5% at the 128 worst hit schools through the government's Behaviour Improvement Programme.", "But speaking after the report was published, Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said: \"Murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence.The home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a Law Commission report which branded the current murder law as \"a mess\".In its report, the Law Commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder.But the Home Office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility.He said the review would look at partial defences to murder, including provocation and at mandatory sentences.David Blunkett has apologised to MPs after the Home Office announced \"prematurely\" via press release a review of murder laws.The Home Office has already said the review will begin next year.On Wednesday, a Home Office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only England and

on Thursday.Richard Dodd, regional director of the Countryside Alliance, said he expected between 2,000 and 4,000 supporters in Tyneside to make their protest, with hunt horns and placards.Animal welfare groups have welcomed the ban, many of whom have campaigned for a ban for decades saying hunting is cruel and unnecessary.The High Court last month ruled the act was valid and the proposed hunting ban was lawful.Pro-hunt supporters are set to protest at Labour's spring conference.Mr Dodd said he did not believe there would be any repeat of the trouble which marred the pro-hunt demonstration outside Parliament in September.A bid to overturn the law banning hunting with dogs in England and Wales has begun in the Court of Appeal.", "BAA also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans.BAA are also owners of the airports at Heathrow and Gatwick.BAA's expansion of Stansted Airport in Essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans.But BAA has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans.Their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at Luton Airport, or when it changed take-off and landing procedures at Heathrow.Opponents say the \u00a32bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from Heathrow and Gatwick was used.The Stansted expansion, apart from the building of the new runway, would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected 50m passengers who will use it every year.At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.At Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway.", "But the home secretary said Mr Howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars.On Thursday, Mr Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Blair had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again.The barrister who had represented Mr Martin had said the rules were \"weighted overwhelmingly\" in favour of the householder, said Mr Clarke.Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens last month backed a Tory attempt to change the law so only householders using \"grossly disproportionate\" force could be prosecuted.Home Secretary Charles Clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law.Mr Howard said the \"grossly disproportionate\" test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders.He said: \"The problem is there has not been enough understanding of it - that was the point Sir John Stevens was making and the prime minister was making.\"Mr Howard branded the decision unacceptable, saying: \"It is not householders who should be

of integrating the first major Muslim nation into the EU.", "His party \"instinctively\" understood the \"new liberal Britain\" which is no longer a nation with one family structure, and one colour, he said.Voters will have a clear choice between the politics of fear and the politics of hope in the next general election, said Charles Kennedy.He said his party was the one of hope and was ready for a 2005 poll.In his New Year message the Liberal Democrat leader said Labour and the Conservatives were united in relying on fear and \"populist scares\".The general election would be a three-party

Government.An artist critical of Welsh arts funding being brought under assembly government control has denied comparing the idea with dictatorships in Russia and Germany.She told Good Morning Wales: \"Just to put the record straight, that business in the paper where it said I likened the government to Bolshevik Russia or Hitler's Germany, the actual quote I gave was: 'It is vital to a civilised society that we allow artists to express themselves without government control'.But Ms James, who won the \u00a330,000 Jerwood painting prize in 2003, said arts funding should be separate from government.It was announced last July that three Welsh quangos, education and training body Elwa, the Wales Tourist Board and the Welsh Development Agency, would be brought under assembly government control.The future of the Arts Council of Wales has been in question since it was announced that most Welsh quangos would eventually be abolished.It would set the arts scene back 60 years, because I really don't think the government has the expertise.\"Comparing the Welsh Assembly Government to Hitler's Germany is a crass and ignorant response to a real issue about democratic

life was the \"most important liberty\" and the government had a duty to protect people from terrorism.New Home Secretary Charles Clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed.On Thursday, Lord Bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions \"in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status\" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not Britons.Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: \"Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.He said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court.\"The law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Law lords were \"simply wrong\" to imply the men were being held arbitrarily.But Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile, the government's independent reviewer of anti-terrorism laws, said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released.The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the

seven years before entering the Commons.Named home secretary after the 2001 general election, Mr Blunkett had seen the focus on his office intensify.In Tony Blair's first government Mr Blunkett was put in charge of education and employment, where he won big increases in funds for schools, while insisting on improved standards of literacy and numeracy.A Labour loyalist from a working class background Mr Blunkett, 57, had been unafraid of pushing for tough changes to Labour policy.Mr Blunkett himself described not being able to see as simply \"an inconvenience\".Mr Blunkett entered Parliament for Sheffield Brightside in 1987, after first contesting the Sheffield Hallam seat in 1974.Before the recent furore, Mr Blunkett had always appeared more interested in politics than his personal life.Lucy was replaced by her half-sister, Sadie, a black Labrador-curly-coated retriever cross, in 2003 after nearly a decade by Mr Blunkett's side.Mr Blunkett told the Daily Telegraph in 2001 that he continued to wear his wedding ring, in spite of being a divorcee, as \"a useful way of ensuring that people don't casually think I am available\".Before he resigned the position of home secretary on Wednesday, David Blunkett had been in charge of a substantial body of government portfolios including race, policing and immigration.Mr Blunkett's own comments on immigration had prompted censure - he told refugees from Afghanistan and Kosovo to \"get back home\" to start rebuilding their countries.", "Millions of public service workers could strike if ministers scrap their final salary pension scheme and make them work longer, warn union leaders.\"To maintain the long-term affordability of our pension scheme, the government announced in its Green Paper on pensions that

generous pensions arrangements in the country.\"Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said changes to pension provisions for workers in the public sector would mean they had to pay in more but

workers did not want to go on strike and called for talks between unions and the highest level of government.Now public service unions are united against the plans and the Trades Union Congress is

Howard said Mr Blunkett had complained he had inherited a \"giant mess\" when he took over at the Home Office from Jack Straw, now foreign secretary.Downing Street has stressed Mr Blair's support for

Blunkett won the first round of a High Court battle with Mrs Quinn for access to her son.Tony Blair is to join Home Secretary David Blunkett in a visit to Sheffield on Thursday.The home secretary has already admitted he was wrong to give the two first class tickets, given to him as an MP, to Mrs Quinn and has since paid the \u00a3180 back.Mr Blunkett declined to comment about his own position, saying the inquiry was under way and the High Court had stressed his right to privacy did not affect his job in improving security and stability.The visit to Sheffield will be seen as a show of unity

although no figure has yet been agreed.Universities Scotland, which represents university principals, claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to Scottish students being squeezed out.Legislation to introduce the top-up fees in England is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all.\"They know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top-up fees if they are going to a university in England and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to Scotland are so inflated.A rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in Scotland.However, Lifelong Learning Minister Jim Wallace said that this would not result in Scottish students missing out.Mr Wallace said: \"Accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which Scottish higher education is held, not just in Britain.Director, David Caldwell, said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at English universities, but this was not a major factor.", "The committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill, such as the law on abandonment of animals which \"would be significantly weakened\".Sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended, the environment select committee said.The MPs said they were \"concerned\" the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare.The draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation, and intends to protect \"kept animals\" and \"companion\" animals by setting up a \"duty of care\".The bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing \"mutilation\" of animals - unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal's best interest.My committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesn't just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place.\"Anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty, a committee of MPs has warned.This was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted - such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect, or unnecessary mental suffering - to go unpunished.Committee chairman Michael Jack said: \"Any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest.", "Earlier Mr Kennedy, whose party opposes the ID cards plan as \"deeply flawed\" said with Christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again.New Home Secretary Charles Clarke has vowed to plough on with plans for ID cards despite a call for him to \"pause for thought\" from Charles Kennedy.The Home Office says people will pay \u00a385 for a passport and ID card together or a undecided fee for a separate ID card.\"ID cards are a means to creating a more secure society,\" he said.The first cards would be issued in 2008 and when he was introducing the bill, Mr Blunkett suggested Parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards, although not to carry them.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Clarke had been reported to be less enthusiastic about ID cards than his predecessors.But Mr Clarke said he had supported the plans when Mr Blunkett argued for them in Cabinet and he supported them now.If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained.\"Mr Clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but he said legislation had already been \"significantly influenced\" by the recommendations of the Commons' home affairs committee.", "He told the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that a \"comprehensive ban\" on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006.She said: \"The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places.The Scottish Green Party's health spokeswoman, Eleanor Scott, said she was pleased Scotland would be following the \"success stories of New York and Ireland\".Mr McConnell said the country's health rates were \"lamentable\" not least because of smoking.In a statement to parliament, Mr McConnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force.Mr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less.The health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost, he told MSPs.The Scottish Conservative Party leader, David McLetchie, questioned what would be exempted from the ban.Earlier, the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places.He said fines of up to \u00a32,500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance.\"It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking.\"", "Divorced parents seeking access to their children are often disadvantaged by the legal system, MPs have said.They said the law should be changed to require family courts specifically to take account of the importance of sustaining the relationship between the child and the non-resident parent in contested cases.\"An arbitrary 'template' imposed on all families, whatever the needs of the child, would relegate the welfare of individual children to a secondary position,\" the MPs said.The Constitutional Affairs Select Committee said parents with custody could exploit delays in the system to stop former partners gaining access.This would \"reassert the rights of non-resident parents to contact with their children, as well as the rights of children to contact with both their parents, while maintaining sufficient flexibility to cope with issues of safety\", they said.Delays in court hearings and the inability to effectively enforce court orders allowed \"a new 'status quo' arrangement for the children to become established by default\", they said.Courts should be used as a last resort, but where they are, their orders should be enforced more rigorously, MPs said.", "The priority should instead be on \"failing states\", including Russia and Pakistan, who cannot properly control their nuclear material, he argues.- Upgrading

backed by the United Nations' authority - Encouraging, pressuring and using \"all available means\" to persuade countries to switch their highly-enriched uranium for less dangerous less-enriched uranium - When possible, taking fissile material away from failing states to safe havens where it can be blended down or converted - Compelling \"failing and rogue states\", and eventually all states, to destroy their nuclear bombs.The UK and US must realise they cannot prevent all terror attacks and should focus on making sure they are not nuclear strikes, says a top academic.In a report for the Foreign Policy Centre think tank, he says a nuclear terrorist attack is the main danger faced by many nations.And he is also worried about Pakistan after one of its top nuclear scientists, Abdul Qadeer Khan, admitted leaking nuclear secrets.He suggests so-called rogue states such as Iran and North Korea are less of a problem than \"failed and failing states\", which are more likely to be a source of nuclear materials.", "Oleg Gordievsky, a senior KGB officer who became a secret agent for the British, said he was \"very happy\" with the way the government have treated him since him since he defected in 1985.Viktor Makarov, 50, claims he has been betrayed by the British authorities, who promised he would live like an \"average British citizen\".But Mr Makarov's case has been backed by David Kahn - a former Yale historian, and a leading expert on code-breaking, who has confirmed his information was valuable to the Western allies.But he says he will remain on hunger strike until he receives a decent pension and the right to work, something he feels he has been denied because the authorities do not trust him.\"I believe the government of the United Kingdom, which in that respect was probably the same as most other power authorities - took the information that Victor Makarov had, wrung him dry and left him to hang out in the cold,\" Mr Kahn said.But despite a \u00a365,000 settlement four years ago, he says he has been denied defector status and a decent pension.But after arriving in London 13 years ago, he feels this promise has not been fulfilled.An ex-Russian intelligence officer who risked his life spying for MI6 is entering the seventh week of a hunger strike near 10 Downing Street.Through his English teacher, he made an approach to M16 - and then began

to learn about the nation's heritage as part of the government's new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups.Citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, Charles Clarke has said.Mr Clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents.\"It represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups,\" said a Home Office spokesman.The Downing Street Strategy Unit in 2003 said people from Indian and Chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings.The Home Office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work.Officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their \"other cultural identities\" alongside being British.\"It is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged.\"Launching the initiative Mr Clarke said enormous

suspicious of \"the motives of some other countries within the EU\" in wanting the ban lifted.The EU embargo on arms exports to China is likely to be lifted in the next six months despite US objections, UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has said.But he said it was wrong to put China under the same embargo as countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma.He said \"it is more likely than not\" that the ban would be lifted before Britain takes over the presidency of the EU from Luxembourg in July.But he said an EU code of conduct would prevent an increase in the number of arms being exported to the country.In December, the EU pledged to work towards lifting the ban but said it was not ready to do so yet.\"If it is lifted we will end up with as effective arms controls in relation to China as we have now.\"US officials say they are not satisfied the mechanisms in the EU code of conduct are robust enough to prevent abuses.", "It also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.A cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said.The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work.Even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under \u00a3200.There were almost \u00a368m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly \u00a312m of them from individual gifts worth more than \u00a31m.The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions.In a new report, the Electoral Commission says it is worth debating a \u00a310,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it.The commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections.", "\"How is it that peace has not arrived?,\" the cardinal will ask.On Friday, the Cardinal will ask the congregation to search for peace.The cardinal used a Christmas message to denounce the war in Iraq as a \"terrible\" waste of money.Billions of pounds spent on conflict in Iraq and in the Middle East should have been used to reduce poverty, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor has said.Both the Cardinal and Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams appealed for the weapons inspectors to be given more time in Iraq before the war started.The cardinal will touch on this theme again on Friday night when he will tell the congregation of 2,000 at Westminster Cathedral that peace is \"worth, always, striving for\".The cardinal said 2005 should be the year for campaigning to \"make history poverty\".\"How can one wish a happy Christmas

year MAB, which opposed the war in Iraq, urged Muslims not to vote for Labour in the European elections.Dr Tamimi said the main issues Muslims should consider were what he referred to as the war on Iraq, the Palestinian situation, the erosion of civil liberties for Muslims in the UK and economic, social and education problems.The constituencies where Labour was most at risk from a Muslim tactical vote were Bethnal Green, in east London, and Rochdale in Lancashire, he added.But Professor Curtice said the Muslim anti-war vote could be split between the Liberal Democrats and Respect, meaning neither would benefit much at the ballot box.\"We know the next government will be Labour, but we are aiming to send a message that it will make a difference if the Muslims use their vote properly.\"There are issues of concern to Muslims, and Muslims generally agree on them but have not in the past been aware of how a vote can serve these issues.\"The chairman of the MCB's public affairs committee, Sher Khan, said the war in Iraq would be a \"significant factor\" affecting Muslims' voting intentions.\"For the most part the Labour constituencies where there's a large Muslim community are relatively safe, but there are one or two that are not quite so safe,\" Professor Curtice said.\"If the next Labour government has a reduced majority that's a great achievement because having a very big majority has been very harmful for politics in this country,\" Dr Tamimi said.", "Efforts are being made to 'protect' workers' days off on Christmas Day and New Year's Day.Usdaw

Cyprus is an EU member, but Turkey, which occupies northern Cyprus, had previously insisted it would not bow to demands to recognise the country, calling the issue a \"red line\".", "The men's solicitor, Louise Christian, has raised questions about whether the evidence was gathered through torture.But the Pentagon told BBC News US policy \"condemns and prohibits\" torture and said there was no evidence that any British detainee was tortured or abused.The Liberal Democrats say they suspect the move is part of a package of security measures agreed with the US in order for the men to be allowed home from Guantanamo Bay.Home Affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also demanded assurances that the evidence against the men was not gained under torture.Amnesty International UK also questioned whether the decisions had been based on \"torture evidence\" obtained at Guantanamo Bay.The government has written to two of the British men freed from Guantanamo Bay telling them they will not be allowed passports.Mr Abbasi, 23, from Croydon, south London, was taken to Guantanamo Bay after being captured in Afghanistan in 2001.A letter sent to Martin Mubanga said his British passport would not

allow parental access were defied, Lord Falconer said.\"We would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand, you know what the minimum access is.Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court.Jim Parton, from Families Need Fathers, said the new proposals \"lacked compulsion\".Other plans include:   - Parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements, based on real-life examples that have worked in the past - Extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases - Better access to legal, emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet - Legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes.Between 15,000 and 20,000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year, although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention.She said a Conservative government would bring a \"radical reform\" of the family courts, as well as enforcing a \"legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation\".Theresa May, shadow secretary for the family, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government's plans were \"inadequate\" and were \"papering over the cracks of the current system\".Parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers.Judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a \"nuclear option\" which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child's interests, a spokesman said.John Ison, from the controversial group Fathers 4 Justice, said: \"It is very disappointing.", "The bill would give legal force to \"living wills\", where people say they want medical treatment withheld if they become severely incapacitated.The Christian Medical Fellowship (CMF) and Lawyers' Christian Fellowship (LCF)

doctors.The Mental Capacity Bill has broad support from charities who say it would give better safeguards over treatment.\"We are against euthanasia, we are against assisted suicide but we are in a situation now where people can make living wills and that has the force of the common law,\" he said.MPs are preparing to debate a bill which critics claim would legalise euthanasia \"by the back

actually provide a series of better safeguards when decisions are made for people who lack capacity,\" the alliance said in a statement.Ministers insist the Mental Capacity Bill - for England and Wales - would not change laws on assisted suicide and contains a presumption in favour of preserving life.The British Medical Association also backs the bill, saying it just gives incapacitated people

keeping UK and foreign terror suspects under house arrest.Mr Clarke has rejected that idea saying intercept evidence is only a small part of the case against terror suspects and could put the lives of intelligence sources at risk.Controversy over the issue continues after a foreign terror suspect held in the UK without trial or charge since December 2001 was freed from jail.Mr Howard said he feared \"internment without trial creates martyrs\" and could be \"a very effective recruiting sergeant\" for terrorists\".The government proposed the idea and a range of other new powers after the laws

colleagues in the Lords.\"No Bill goes through Parliament without detailed consideration being made, but I believe that what I announced yesterday will be sufficient to secure the agreement of the House of Lords,\" he said.The Bill now faces opposition from peers angry at house arrest proposals.MPs voted in favour of the Prevention of Terrorism Bill after Mr Clarke agreed to key changes - but Labour's majority was reduced to 14.Speaking after the Commons debate, shadow home secretary David Davies said the bill had been \"clearly very badly drawn-up\" and that the government was trying to rush it through too quickly.\"I have no desire to make further so-called concessions on the Bill.\"Mr Clarke won over critics by announcing he would introduce an amendment in the Lords to ensure the most controversial control order, amounting to house arrest, would be imposed by judges and not politicians.BBC News political editor Andrew Marr said: \"I think that this is a bill in deep

including the Joint Strike Fighter, the Nimrod and A400M aircraft and the Type 45 Destroyer, which were resonsible for the bulk of the cost over-runs and delay.The NAO's annual report showed the total cost of the 20 projects covered was expected to reach \u00a350bn - 14% higher than originally planned.A National Audit Office report on the 20 biggest projects says costs have risen by \u00a31.7bn in

safeguards in the chosen countries.\"A spokesman for the Home Office said it was wholly wrong to suggest that the plan was to return children \"and leave them to rot\".The pilot, included in the government's five-year immigration plan, aims to return unaccompanied asylum-seeking children from Albania who have failed in their asylum claims.\"We do not believe that it is right, or in keeping with children's legislation, that children who can return should remain in the UK indefinitely separated from their families and communities.\"\"In Albania particularly there is no statutory child care or protection structure.\"From what is so far known, we strongly oppose the scheme because the welfare and best interests of the child will not properly be taken into account,\" said Mr Hogg.\"We have been exploring how we can establish reception and longer-term care arrangements in countries of origin and believe that it's possible to return children in a way that is in their best interests

to act in the \"best interest\" of a child in their care.", "The risk of pets and children being given votes could be cut by changing how people register to vote, the UK elections watchdog has said.Mr Younger said using the Royal Mail's postal redirection service had already helped election officers retrace about 50,000 voters.The Electoral Commission says enabling people to register individually could cut some errors and combat fraud.Mr Younger suggested the re-registration could happen less frequently but argued efforts were needed to check the electoral rolls were up-to-date.There have been fears there are too few checks to ensure current postal votes are cast by the person on the voting form.The proposed scheme would mean voters using individual \"identifiers\" when they vote - such as their own voting number, date of birth and signature.Chairman Sam Younger told MPs on Tuesday care was needed to ensure that people were not lost off the register in the process - which happened when Northern Ireland switched to a similar system.The Electoral Commission says having voters register individually rather than the head of household do it for them fits better with human rights laws.Mr

Westminster Foundation for Democracy, the Football Licensing Authority, Investors in People UK and the Economic and Social Research Council.Mr Lewis branded the existence of the 60-employee Potato

had been an \"explosion\" of them.He urged a limit on the number of quangos that could be set up by any individual government department.Conservative deregulation spokesman John Redwood said: \"The

EU asylum policy, which meant the UK could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case.In a speech in London on Monday, Mr Howard said: \"It's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it.\"The plans would help achieve a \"substantial reduction\" in immigration, he said, although he could not predict a figure.Mr Howard said nearly 160,000 people were

was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing,\" he said.The spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future.He said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no, they were not rung again.\"When we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not,\" he said.Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.The parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people's voting intentions.A Conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang TPS subscribers.A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising.But seven million telephone numbers are on the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) lists, which

to be seen whether the social disapproval of the drinking driver will stay at the current rate if the alcohol limit is cut.The research, carried out by transport expert professor Richard Allsop, says cutting the limit would also lead to 230 fewer serious injuries on the UK's roads compared with 2003.These have been criticised by road safety campaigners, including Labour backbencher Gwyneth

said ID cards could \"help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives\".He said: \"This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards.\"He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would \"set out the position very clearly\" when he stands up to debate the matter next week.He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration.Tory ex-minister Douglas Hogg said he opposed the plans for ID cards branding them a \"regressive\" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits.They said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them.But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans \"stink\".Sources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to

the referendum, expected in 2006.Jack Straw, who argues the constitution reflected a \"British vision for Europe\" and gives \"national governments a stronger grip\", has said the referendum could be held in spring 2006.But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as \"two separate issues\".Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, who backs the constitution, said he expected the referendum would come in the first half of next year.Neil O'Brien, director of anti-constitution group Vote No, said: \"The reality is that the government doesn't want to discuss the EU constitution ahead of the election because they know it is extremely unpopular with voters and with business.\"The UK Independence Party said: \"If the government believes that a No vote would mean that we should leave the European Union, they should just ask us if we want to leave the EU.Mr Blair signed the constitution at a ceremony in Rome in November, but had already made it clear the issue would be put to voters in a referendum.Conservative shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said the referendum question \"seems straightforward\".\"If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,\" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who along with the rest of the Cabinet, will back a \"yes\" vote.", "Labour MP Diane Abbot, who backs Mr Phillips' proposal of shortlists, said she had been elected along with three other ethnic minority MPs - Keith Vaz, Paul

been rejected by one of Labour's most senior Asians.On Tuesday Labour chairman Ian McCartney said his party was \"ambitious\" to improve black and Asian representation.That came after it emerged that

new arrangements, revealed in a Commons written statement, would raise up to \u00a3680m for Britain's nuclear clean-up programme, under the new Nuclear Decommissioning Agency.Under current contracts, British Nuclear Fuels should return all but low level waste, but none has ever been sent back.Intermediate waste from countries such as Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Sweden will be

pre-election spats come after Mr Blair told Labour members the Tories offered a \"hard right agenda\" which would take Britain backwards.But Mr Clarke accused him of trying to score \"cheap political points\" by muddling immigration with asylum.Mr Blair's was asked last Wednesday if the government's new immigration plans, including a point system for economic migrants, would reduce net migration.Mr Clarke said he had made clear the UK would welcome genuine economic migrants for key jobs on a strict points based system.Earlier, Dr Fox accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers of telling lies about Tory policies and then attacking the lies.London's Evening Standard quoted Mr Clarke telling Labour activists at a question and answer session in Gateshead that he wanted Britain to offer refuge for those fleeing tyranny.Mr Clarke dismissed the latest Tory attack.Labour has already broken its pre-election promise on immigration before the ink has dried on its new pledge card, the

and the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas.In an interview with the BBC's political editor Andrew Marr, Mr Blair said getting progress between Israelis and Palestinians would be \"tough, but at least we have got the first step\".Before visiting Israel, Mr Blair made a surprise visit to Iraq, where he met leaders in Baghdad during his first trip to the city.Earlier, Mr Sharon again said he had not

about this by those that support hunting.The rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law, which came into force on Friday, and pretended they were not.He said

said: \"By making express provision for murder tariffs in the Criminal Justice Act, Parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences.Amanda's uncle, Lewis Champion, told the BBC News website Ford did not deserve any credit for his plea, saying: \"Nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence.\"\"There is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences - such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the government's claim to be tough on crime,\" he said.They say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders.Shadow home secretary David Davis echoed criticisms of the way Mr Blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules.At present judges, when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence, can reduce the tariff - the minimum term they must serve - if the defendant pleads guilty.It is also calling on the senior judge in England and Wales, Lord Woolf, to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in September to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty.In July this year

away?\"\"If all the dogs are doing is barking at the deer, then nobody can define that as hunting.\"The new law banning hunting with dogs is \"so poorly drafted\" no-one can define the offence,

not hunting.", "\"But Powys Local Health Board is committed to ensuring our patients receive the care that is appropriate,\" said the assembly government.The contract with the Powys health board was

being accelerated.Napier said that the practice, where prisoners use buckets in their cells as toilets, breached his human rights.On Thursday, the Court of Session threw out a move by the executive to apply a more rigorous standard of proof.Napier, a remand prisoner at the time, raised a legal challenge in 2001 under the European Convention on Human Rights, in which he sought \u00a35,000.The executive faces more than 1,000 similar claims for damages from prisoners and former inmates.Scottish National Party Justice Minister Kenny MacAskill said that the slopping out case had been \"a

hospital itself would work together on preparing the report.The executive spokeswoman said the recommendation for leave was agreed by a psychiatric advisor \"in conjunction with officials on behalf of

would \"cut deep into public service\".\"This will be the central dividing line at the election, between a Conservative Party taking Britain back and planning deep cuts of \u00a335bn in our services, and a Labour government taking Britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, I am proud to say, spend by 2008 \u00a360bn more.\"The chancellor said the vote - expected to fall on 5 May - will give a \"clear and fundamental\" choice between Labour investment and Conservative cuts.He said after seven years Labour had transformed from a party not trusted with the economy to \"the only party trusted with the economy\".It was now a \"party not just of employees, but of employers and managers\", he said.To a packed audience at Gateshead's Sage Centre, the chancellor said the cuts proposed by shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, GP and nurse in the country, he told activists.", "In November, MPs urged ministers to make councils create sites because 3,500 travellers have no place to stop.Ms Cooper said an annual scheme to refurbish existing traveller sites would now be extended to consider council bids for new stopping places.\"There are two major problems in the planning system at the moment concerning Gypsy and traveller sites,\" said Ms Cooper.Numerous communities and councils were paying for lengthy and expensive evictions against travelling communities, said the MPs.More money is to be given to councils to develop official caravan parks, said housing minister Yvette Cooper.Under the new regulations, expected to be in force in the spring, officials will be able to serve \"temporary stop notices\" aimed at preventing works on a site before a council has had chance to obtain a full legal ban.In their November report, MPs from the committee scrutinising the Office for the Deputy Prime Minister, responsible for housing, said most illegal traveller encampments were caused by a lack of places to stop.Andrew Ryder, of the Traveller Law Reform Coalition, said: \"We welcome talk about an obligation on councils to identify land for Gypsies

Leader, Mr Llwyd has argued that some of the terror attacks may have had the involvement of the security services and not Meibion Glyndwr.Plaid Cymru's Elfyn Llwyd has suggested the security services could have been involved, with the intention of discrediting the nationalist vote.Ex-Welsh Office Minister Lord Roberts of Conwy denied security services were involved.A Plaid Cymru MP believes UK security services were involved in some arson attacks blamed on Welsh extremists.He believes that elements of the British security services may have carried out renegade actions in order to discredit Plaid Cymru and the nationalist vote ahead of elections.He denied that the security services played any improper role.The programme also heard from Lord Roberts of Conwy, who was a Welsh Office

its limits.The alliance says hunt supporters will go out and test this law to its limits on Saturday.But it says the ban is unenforceable because the law is unclear and impossible to police.The decision on how to police individual hunts will be left to local forces, with more officers sent to hunts where disruption is expected.Others are expected to defy the ban by continuing to hunt illegally.The League Against Cruel Sports and the RSPCA say they will monitor hunts and assist police in bringing prosecutions.The Countryside Alliance had its latest legal bid to block the ban

headquarters of Quorn hunt in Leicestershire, feelings were running high as hunt enthusiasts prepared for their final legal hunt.", "Concessions on a bill which critics claim would allow euthanasia \"through the back door\" were not a political ploy, the lord chancellor has said.Tony Blair said he would do everything he could to meet concerns about the bill.It was inevitable that minds became more focused as the bill went through Parliament but the result was a \"sensible solution\", he said.Lord Falconer said it was fair to criticise the late timing of the offer.Lord Falconer says there will be amendments when the bill goes to the House of Lords.The revolt was also reduced by news that Lord Falconer had promised the Catholic archbishop of Cardiff to strengthen safeguards in the bill.He told BBC News: \"We have given a commitment to put into the bill a clause that says that nothing in the bill authorises any act where the motive of the person authorising the decision is to end life.\"It is important we don't end up in the situation where doctors and consultants are confused about the law and may lay themselves open to prosecution in circumstances where no sensible person would want that to happen,\" he said.He said the changes provided a solution to a very difficult issue but some MPs argue the situation is still unclear.On Tuesday, the government saw off a backbench attempt to force changes to the bill by 297 votes to 203, despite rebellion by 34 Labour MPs.", "He said: \"You've got to bring back school sport.The prime minister launched a \u00a3500m

it is to look at the other end of the spectrum and try to enable the clubs - which is where the real passion for sport exists - to deliver the school sport offer.\"But the Conservatives warned of rising obesity levels and said that since only a third of children do two hours of sport a week currently, the government is promising something it cannot guarantee.\"It's an important part of education and it's an important part of health,\" Mr Blair said.The \u00a3500m move will also increase the number of specialist sport colleges from 350 to 400.He said more emphasis should be put on traditional sports, saying that an \"anti-competitive sport agenda\" had been pursued in recent years.Tony Blair has promised that \"sport is back\" as a priority for schools.", "Mr Clarke says he does not intend to use the house arrest powers now - even for the 11 current terror detainees.Plans to allow Home Secretary Charles Clarke to place terror suspects under house arrest without trial are set for their first real test in Parliament.Mr Clarke says the powers are needed to counter terror threats.He questioned why there was \"such a rush\" to introduce the legislation when Mr Clarke had indicated he was not planning to use the house arrest powers straight away.The new powers, designed to replace the existing laws and meet the Law Lords' concerns, would apply to British as well as foreign terror suspects.In a rare move, the Tories and Lib Dems have jointly tabled a motion opposing the new bill, saying the house arrest plans are \"excessive\".The two opposition parties are particularly worried that the control orders would initially be imposed on the say-so of the home secretary, rather than a judge.It proposes \"control orders\", which would mean house arrest in the most serious cases, and curfews, electronic tagging and limits on telephone and internet access for other suspects.Opposition MPs are also angry they will have only two days - Wednesday and next Monday - to debate the new plans before they pass to the House of Lords.Mr Clarke said the security services and police backed his measures and it would be \"rash and negligent\" to ignore their advice.", "Former Northern Ireland minister Sir Nicholas Scott has died at a London hospice, his family has announced.As a Northern Ireland minister he dealt with education and later security where he

statement had not been \"written by or at Number 10\".Former minister Clare Short, who resigned from the government over the Iraq war, said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action.But a short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action.This is argument was rejected by Mr Blair, who said: \"Firstly, we haven't broken the precedent, and secondly Peter Goldsmith has made his statement and I have got absolutely nothing to add to it.\"\"That's what he (Lord Goldsmith) said and that's what I say.Lord Goldsmith has denied being \"leaned on\" and says the words written were his.In a book published this week,

Whittingdale said the way the government had handled the bill was a \"shambles\".Instead there will be a cap of eight new casinos in each size category - small, medium and large.The Culture Secretary

task was to \"rebuild a sense of domestic purpose\" within the US, he said.Mr Blair said states had to work with the US to fight global terrorism.Even before the result became clear, Mr Blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won.The election of the US president was significant for the world but particularly so for Britain

British government wanted no part of it and wanted Guantanamo Bay shut down.But he said there were still \"serious questions\" both over the possible threat the four pose to the UK, and the treatment they received while detained.Asked about possible damages Mr Begg and the other detainees could bring against the US, Mr Godsiff said: \"People get released from prison when it's found that their prosecution was unsustainable and they are quite rightly awarded sizeable sums of money.Lawyer Louise Christian, who represents Mr Abbasi and Mr Mubanga, said the government should have acted

just deal with aid and debt but will also deal on issues of governance within African countries and conflict resolution,\" he said.But he pledged that Africa - which sees a \"preventable\" tsunami-size death toll every month from conflict, disease and poverty - would not be neglected.UK aid to help the victims of the Asian tsunami disaster will not take much needed relief from Africa,

Work and Pensions where 2,000 jobs are threatened.", "\"As Lord Woolf also acknowledged, it is highly unlikely that the lord chancellor would appoint a judge against the wishes of the lord chief justice.Lord Woolf said the current rules were not written down but it was inconceivable in practice that the lord chancellor would overrule his concerns.In written evidence to the committee, Lord Woolf said: \"I have, so far, failed to reach an agreement with the lord chancellor on this issue ...Lord Woolf said he was determined his current veto on whether a judge should chair an inquiry should continue as a guard for judicial independence.Lord Woolf, who is Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, was giving evidence to the Commons public administration select committee's inquiry into public inquiries.But he told MPs the Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, was insisting he should have the final say in such cases.The government says the lord chancellor would be unlikely to go against Lord Woolf's wishes.A Department for Constitutional Affairs spokeswoman said Lord Woolf and Lord Falconer agreed about what happened in practice.He said he had not been involved in the choice of Lord Hutton, who as a law lord did not come under his jurisdiction.\"What I am asking for is a situation where if the lord chancellor cannot obtain my agreement [on appointing a judge], it doesn't happen,\" he said.", "Mr Howard appointed Mr Crosby as his elections chief last October.Mr Crosby's statement said: \"The Conservative Party has been making an impact on the issues of lower tax and

students being registered to vote near their university, not in their home towns.The party says the votes of students can win it 27 new seats at the poll.The figures assume all students will vote in their university town.Although the expected 5 May election would be during term time, students can vote by post.The Conservatives say they would abolish university tuition fees and instead offer large student loans at commercial rates of interest.He said: \"Top-up fees put students off university, especially those from a poorer background.Some hall wardens are reluctant to register students because of data protection fears - but students can get themselves registered.Labour has pushed through plans to let universities charge fees of up to \u00a33,000 a year, with the poorest students eligible for non-repayable support of up to \u00a33,000.\"They are committed to abandoning Labour's targets of getting 50% of 18 to 30-year-olds going into higher education and under Lib Dem plans students would even have to study near home.\"", "\"Yet throughout our inquiry we have seen time and time again that extremely vulnerable people are entering custody with a history of mental illness, drug and alcohol problems and potential for taking their own lives.\"There was one prison suicide every four days between 1999 and 2003, MPs said.The report, which followed a year-long inquiry by the committee, found the high death rate \"amounts to a serious failure to protect the right to life of a highly vulnerable group\".The misplaced over-reliance on the prison system for some of the most vulnerable people in the country is at the heart of the problems that we encountered.Committee chairman Labour MP Jean Corston said: \"Each and every death in custody is a death too many, regardless of the circumstances.The committee also highlighted \"deeply worrying\" cases of children and young people taking their own lives.Many of those who ended up taking their own lives had \"presented themselves\" to the authorities with these problems before they even offended, the report said.The joint committee on human rights found those committing suicide were mainly the most vulnerable, with mental health, drugs or alcohol problems.", "New rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the UK are coming into force.The Home Office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages, of which there are estimated to be up to 15,000 a year.\"These rules means in some cases the Home Secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort.Rhian Beynon of the JCWI said the new rules were \"not proportionate\" and \"discriminatory\".But from Tuesday all non-EU nationals, apart from citizens of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland or Norway, intending to wed in the UK must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a Home Office 'certificate of marriage approval'.Mr Rimmer, the service director for registrations of marriages at Brent Council in north-west London, said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties.Registrars' spokesman, Mark Rimmer, said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent.In a report published last July the cross-party committee stated there was a \"significant risk\" the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were \"disproportionate\".The role of registrars who under the Asylum and Immigration Act 1999 were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the Home Office, has been key in many prosecutions.We'll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we'll be looking at taking a case on this to the Human Rights Court,\" Ms Beynon said.From Tuesday, most non-EU citizens will need Home Office approval to marry.The new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights.", "Javier Solana, EU foreign policy chief, says phone-tap evidence works in the courts of other European countries.Mr Solana told ITV1's Jonathan Dimbleby programme: \"[Phone-tap evidence in court] works, it is normal that it is done, it would be naive not to do it.But Home Secretary Charles Clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases.Human rights groups, top police officers and many MPs say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge.But critics of phone-tap trials say the evidence is often weak and can expose the methods of the security services.The government is being naive by refusing to allow phone-tap evidence in court, a senior EU politician says.Several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court.The home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance.", "Record numbers of schools across the UK are to take part in a mock general election backed by the government.Michael Raftery, project manager at the Hansard

Brown was \"getting in the way of good government\".According to Mr Peston the prime minister said: \"Help me to get through the year and I will then stand down.\"According to a new book, Brown's Britain, Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown after Cabinet allies intervened in June 2004.Mr Blair said: \"I've dealt with this six months ago.And that at a dinner hosted by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott he told Mr Brown of his intention to stand down.During the interview Mr Blair also said the former home secretary David Blunkett would play a \"big role\" at the general election.Tory leader Michael Howard accused the prime minister and Mr Brown of \"squabbling like schoolboys\".But, in a wide-ranging BBC interview covering issues such as the Asian tsunami disaster, the Middle East peace process and Northern Ireland, Mr Blair said: \"When you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you.But the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a \"load of nonsense\".Tony Blair has dismissed reports he told Gordon Brown he would quit before the next general election.", "Ms Jamieson said the executive should have a role in tackling the soccer troublemakers.Ms Jamieson praised the police for their action and said: \"The police do want to identify whether there are particular individuals who are

\"trigger\" for tensions and violence.Cathy Jamieson said exclusion orders are one of a series of measures being considered in the Scottish Executive campaign against sectarianism.\"That's the kind of thing that will hit those kind of people where it hurts the most in not allowing them to attend the games,\" she said.Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Sunday Live programme, Ms Jamieson described Friday's meeting as \"very productive\" and said putting the squeeze on the bigots would be a key aim.\"Both Rangers and Celtic football clubs have been involved in working with the executive to produce, for example, an educational pack for young people.\"Last week Ms Jamieson and First Minister Jack McConnell met supporters' representatives from both clubs to discuss the issue.", "Anyone planning to move to the UK will have to pass a test to prove they can contribute to the country, Home Secretary Charles Clarke has said.Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \"Whilst it is good that Labour has rejected the Tory idea of quotas on asylum, the jury is still out on the Home Office's ability to deliver a fair and efficient asylum system.\"Mr Clarke, who will unveil his plans on Monday, said economic migration helped the UK but \"needed proper policing\".The Refugee Council said Mr Howard's proposals would mean there would be no safe haven in the UK.The home secretary said, by 2008, he wanted everyone given a visa and entering the UK to have their fingerprints taken, to \"ensure we can know everybody who is in the country\".He said: \"We will establish a system ... which looks at the skills, talents and abilities of people seeking to come and work in this country, and ensures that when they come here they have a job and can contribute to the economy of the country.\"\"The issue of who does come into this country, and whether they are entitled to be in this country, who does settle here, how we have border controls, is a perfectly legitimate aspect of public debate,\" he said.", "The law lords' ruling came on Charles Clarke's first day as home secretary last Thursday following David Blunkett's resignation.New Home Secretary Charles Clarke said he would carefully consider the ruling and would return to Parliament early in the new year with proposals.House of Lords law lords ruled against the detention measures last week.Lord Bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions \"in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status\" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not Britons.Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: \"Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.\"The home secretary has defended his decision not to release foreign terror suspects despite a legal ruling their detention breached human rights laws.In a statement on the same day, Mr Clarke said: \"I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year.But the government was widely criticised for insisting the detentions would continue following the ruling last week.They said it was wrong to have one set of laws for foreign suspects and another for British suspects.", "British voters would reject the European constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.The Daily Telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour.But he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the EU referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as \"two separate issues\".The constitution will be incorporated into UK law if there is a yes vote.Another 7% said they would not vote at all.\"If we reject this treaty, Britain will be isolated and weak in Europe,\" said Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, after the question was unveiled.", "Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said voters now have a \"fundamental lack of trust\" of Tony Blair as prime minister.He said backing his party was not a wasted vote, adding that with the Lib Dems \"what you see is what you get\".But he said Mr Blair had lost the trust of the British people.\"There is a fundamental lack of trust in Tony Blair as prime minister and in his government,\" he said.Mr Kennedy said during his nearly 22 years in Parliament he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of British politics.Mr Blair has already spent a day with Five and Michael Howard is booked for a similar session.", "The law lords said the measures were incompatible with European human rights laws.But Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, the one law lord to oppose the appeal, said the anti-terror laws contained important safeguards against oppression.Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: \"Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.On Thursday, senior law lord Lord Bingham said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions \"in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status\".He said the weakness for the government's case was that it was trying to justify detention without trial for foreign suspects - but not for British suspects.Lord Hoffmann said: \"The real threat to the life of the nation, in the sense of a people living in accordance with its traditional laws and political values, comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these.\"In a blow to the government's anti-terror measures, the House of Lords law lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by nine detainees.The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case.Detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws, the UK's highest court has ruled.But that ruling was later overturned by the Court of Appeal who said there was a state of emergency threatening the life of the nation.", "The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war.In Mr Peston's book Mr Brown is alleged to have told the prime minister: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe.\"At a campaign poster launch on Tuesday, Mr Brown was joined by Alan Milburn, who Mr Blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor.Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston.On Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: \"They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line.\"The prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent

Parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards, although not to carry them.Mr Clarke, writing in The Times, accused some critics of \"liberal woolly thinking and spreading false fears\" by claiming ID cards would erode civil liberties.\"If you were running a family or a business would you have the second reading of the Identity Cards Bill tomorrow or would you pause to reflect and see what you might do about it in the New Year?Mr Clarke is expected to try and win over opponents to the scheme by saying officials who secretly accessed

controversial ID cards bill.Mr Clarke, who took on the post on Thursday after David Blunkett quit, has rejected calls to \"pause\" on the bill.Critics argue that introducing the cards would be a costly scheme with no specific aim.The new bill would also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents.He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would

say that the investigation which had already occurred \"has been timely, open or effective\", the judges said.The High Court ruled on Tuesday that Baha Mousa's death in British custody in Iraq fell within the European Convention on Human Rights.The other five Iraqis did not die in custody, so their cases had to fail, they said.Ministry of Defence lawyers argued the UK-controlled area of southern Iraq was outside European jurisdiction.The Iraqi families' lawyer argued that failing to adequately investigate the death breached the European Convention on Human Rights.He was allegedly beaten to death while in the custody of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment.But former British Commander Colonel Bob Stewart said : \"Anyone at the top [of the military] will be saddened by the verdict that has taken place but will say: 'If there's a case to answer, let's have it out.The family of an Iraqi civilian allegedly killed by UK troops have won a challenge against the government's refusal to order a

out.", "And the law protects those who use \"something to hand\" as a weapon, said the leaflet published jointly by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).In cases involving householders attacking intruders prosecutors and police were \"determined\" they would be dealt with \"as swiftly and as sympathetically as possible\", it said.The Tories have called for a change in the law so householders are only prosecuted if they use \"grossly disproportionate\" force.Doing what you \"honestly and instinctively\" believed was necessary would be the strongest evidence of acting lawfully, the guidance said.The guidance published on Tuesday, said the police had a duty to investigate all incidents involving a death or injury.A CPS spokesperson said the figures were not definitive because prosecutions are not listed according to whether they were committed by a householder on an intruder.The leaflet, published by police and prosecutors, aims to combat confusion about current legislation, which lets people use \"reasonable force\".The law also protects those who use \"something to hand\" as a weapon.But knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further, or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of \"excessive and gratuitous\" force.", "In revised proposals from the Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC), the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be \"weighed carefully\" by a judge so they did not lead to \"an inappropriately short sentence\".The guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible, by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co-operation, he said.Director of Public Prosecutions, Ken Macdonald QC, who sits on the SGC, said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament.Where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty, the maximum reduction would be one sixth, and should never exceed five years, it said.At the time Lord Woolf, the Lord Chief Justice, had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances - for example, if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected.\"What the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process.", "Ms Gavron said she thought Mr Livingstone's comments were \"inappropriate\" but she did not

people were joined together in partnership making it work\".The best performing police services would get more cash and extra freedoms, he said, but he would not shirk from stepping in where the public was being failed.Mr Blunkett said a new three digit number would be created for non-emergency phone calls to police.Police forces were already \"buried\" under existing government initiatives and there was little in the latest plans to reassure them,\" said Mr Davis.Earlier Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said the government was right to want to increase the links between local people and the police.He has also started to recruit 25,000 Community Support Officers (CSOs) and the new plans would allow all police forces to give them the power to detain suspects.The home secretary said targets would be put in place to ensure that the public got a good response from police.Local people would also be able to \"trigger\" action on specific problems if they felt nothing was being done.The plans also include the idea of allowing people join police forces at different levels rather than the traditional way of making everybody spend specific amounts of time as a

exchanges - because of the facility they provide to bet against a result - has increased the potential for corruption.The report recommended the governing bodies of sports have a say in the type of bets offered to punters, and for bookmakers to set up \"audit trails\" - something the new betting exchanges already do - to allow suspicious betting patterns to be traced.The Parliamentary Group on Betting and Gaming held a substantial inquiry into betting last year.The all-party group recommended 15 ways to protect punters and improve the integrity of sports betting.A group of MPs and peers has

Scotland is set to rise by an average of about 4% in the coming year, BBC Scotland has learned.There are also warnings that unless funding to councils is increased in the next few years then services may have to be reduced.\"That's a 5.5% increase and sits against an inflation rate of 1.6%, so I think we have quite rightly said to councils this year that we would at the very least ask them to exercise restraint.\"They say the funding plans for the next three years will see councils lose more of the share of public spending.\"Scared of actually using its three pence income tax that it could

represents university vice-chancellors, Universities UK, said the new system of deferred fees in England, due to start in 2006, with grants and bursaries for poorer students, would encourage more of them to go into higher education.Instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier, even down to primary school level, to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to, he said.The Higher Education Minister, Kim Howells, said: \"We are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas.\"Teenagers from well-off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas, a report says.The Hefce report, drawing on child benefits data, said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than 50% chance of going to university, while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was 10%.The shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, said: \"It is clear from this report that children from disadvantaged areas are far more likely to have encountered poor standards in their secondary education.Higher standards in schools would lead to greater participation in higher education.He said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils, between the ages of 16 and 18, it was too late.The report also showed women were 18% more likely than men to enter higher education in 2000 - up from 6% in 1994.", "Mr Kennedy will also highlight the anger among people of \"all races\" over the Iraq war and call for a \"balanced approach\" to tackling

mean \"tough measures to make Britain safe - but not at the expense of people's fundamental legal rights like has happened at Belmarsh\".Mr Kennedy is to tell the audience: \"Many people in Britain, of all races, cultures and religions, were angry about the way we were taken to war in Iraq.He will say it also means acting through the United Nations on terrorism.He will also say that the Lib Dems

debate with his political rivals ahead of the next election.Before the 2001 election, plans for a debate between Mr Blair, William Hague and Charles Kennedy collapsed.In 1997 a debate between Mr Blair and John Major was also cancelled when a format could not be agreed.", "The issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice.We have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like Iraq.We would like the support of political parties but I think a general election is very much to do with pledges MPs make to their electors.A general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy.Tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that's an increase of about \u00a3750.Whether or not we will get a ban I am not sure.We will seek to get pledges from individual MPs and would-be MPs saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports.Pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of Adair Turner's full report into the issue.Politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue.If we've got one in five pensioners below the poverty line, we've got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty.He wanted the issue off the table until after the election.But there is no guarantee they will vote for a Labour government this time around.With hunting we had many MPs who were happy to say they were against it.It's become an issue in itself but what's really missing from the debate is the consumer's choice in that.We have seen so many pensions mis-selling scandals and in the pensions industry there's a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that.Whatever we do, the public don't like lorries - they see us as a complaining minority.They will be asked which of the top five issues, including the pension issue, they would support.We want choice on the consumer's terms - that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice.I think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda.We've called for the state pension to be increased from \u00a379.60 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of \u00a3105.45.People using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad.We are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country, they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters.Regrettably it's one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press.Whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time.Everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban.Choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools.It is hard to say whether we will be successful.We will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the UK.The language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum.But they don't realise that when you see a car on the road it is probably going to work, when you see a lorry it's already at work.The reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting.We haven't worked out specific plans but I imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent MPs.", "It was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that Gordon Brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government's response to the disaster while Mr Blair was still on holiday in Egypt.The prime minister denied all that as well, repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign.And he again heaped praise on Mr Brown saying he was doing a great job, and would continue doing it - although he would not commit to any job for Mr Brown after the election.So why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with Mr Brown's long-arranged keynote speech on aid and debt, he was asked?It dominated the prime minister's monthly news conference, which saw Mr Blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour.All this came amid fresh claims that Mr Brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had, as a result, started to set out his own platform.As far as the timing of the prime minister's press conference is concerned, there are two options.The first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment.And he repeated what a great man Gordon was and how united they were, before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers, preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world.This time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government's global aid and debt initiatives, particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster - an issue many hoped and believed was above such things.Either way, the effect was the same - to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue.", "He said the prime minister

re-elected.There are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put a lid on all the speculation.Then there are the actions of the men themselves.They started with and are sustained by \"friends\" of the two men.Mr Blair talked about the \"New\" Labour manifesto - a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor, who has long rejected the label.For example, the weekend's attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick.Ian Gibson, for example, urged the two men to stop squabbling, declaring: \"For goodness sake, sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can.\"Few in Westminster actually believe that, simply because the evidence appears to contradict it.Tony Blair and Gordon

other.\"Relations between Mr Brown and Mr Milburn are widely reported to be cool ever since Mr Blair brought the latter back into the Cabinet to run Labour's election campaign, a role successfully carried out by Mr Brown in both 1997 and 2001.The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election

poisonous briefing\".Mr Blair has insisted he has done no deals over the premiership while Mr Brown says he will not let \"gossip\" distract him from helping a unified election campaign.But he argued Mr Blair and Mr Brown could work successfully together and had produced a strong economy and better public services.New speculation about the state of their relationship was sparked by claims in Brown's Britain, by Sunday Telegraph journalist Robert Peston, which suggested Mr Blair went back on a pledge to make way for Mr Brown.Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential.Mr Prescott said there were occasional disagreements in any government.", "The views expressed by both backbenchers and Labour peers over the claimed squabbling between the two men starkly demonstrated the widely-held view within the Labour party that the two most powerful figures in the government are jeopardising the next election.The dressing down appears to have done the trick, with Mr Brown joining his alleged rival Alan Milburn - who the prime minister put in charge of election planning in Mr Brown's stead - and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott at an election poster launch.Even as the MPs were expressing their fears it emerged that, while Mr Brown is in Africa for a week, the prime minister is to deliver a keynote speech on election themes for a third term.If there is one thing certain to stiffen the spines of Labour MPs it is the prospect of losing their seats at a general election.Similarly, some were pointing out that the chancellor, during the election poster launch, once again refused to deny the claim that he told the prime minister he could never trust anything he said.As one hugely-disgruntled backbencher said before the meeting: \"It is time they realised it's not just my seat they are threatening but if they go on like this they could put the election in doubt.\"As Paul Flynn said: \"What has deeply upset the party is in this time of all times, when we wanted to come together, we wanted to lead on the global issues, to change politics for the next decade, the whole thing was wrecked by a piece of childishness by the two main people in the party, two people we greatly respect.\"Even Mr Prescott admitted that, had he still been a backbencher, he would have been giving Mr Blair and Mr Brown the same message.None the less, what some believe now is that the effect of the warnings from the backbenchers will actually be to silence the Brown camp, effectively strengthening the prime minister's hand.", "I care about myself and when the sun's shining I think - fantastic,\" replied Mr MacKenzie.His advice for one young contestant was to \"get a haircut and a brain transplant\".Mr Lim later reduced the panel to fits of giggles as he outlined his plan to make people do community service instead of paying taxes.\"Any of them would make competent MPs,\" former independent MP Martin Bell insisted on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.Mr MacKenzie thought the smooth-talking former solicitor - with a hardline on crime and immigration - deserved a chance to progress.Irfan Hanif, a 25-year-old doctor from Bolton, made a good impression, even if he was a little thrown by Mr MacKenzie's suggestion that instead of being treated by the NHS, young drunks should \"given a good beating\" and left to die.\"That was an total disaster.Among the more eccentric policy proposals was a public holiday on Bruce Forsyth's birthday and Bill Oddie for prime minister.\"When the prime minister turns to the chancellor and says how much have we got in the coffers Mr Brown, he says well, prime minister, bad news, all the houses in Britain have been painted but actually nobody has paid any tax,\" observed Mr MacKenzie.But Ms

MacKenzie, in the Simon Cowell, Mr Nasty seat.But opinion is divided on whether any of the potential candidates unearthed so far have got what it takes to make it in politics.Mr Bell, who will be offering his advice to the contestants on Wednesday, argues that Westminster has its share of \"odd balls\" and the show will engage ordinary voters.They were then cross-examined by the panel, which was chaired by ex-ITN political editor John Sergeant, with television host Lorraine Kelly taking the Nicki Chapman role.", "The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the

with the chancellor since taking Mr Brown's traditional poll planning role.Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston.Mr Prescott said there was a dinner but the discussions were confidential.On Tuesday, deputy prime minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: \"They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line.\"But the pair chatted amicably and Mr Brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task.", "The event may have been designed to highlight Labour's economic success under Mr Brown, but there was little doubt who was in charge.But it was Mr Milburn who took centre stage, speaking of the \"positive campaign\" the party hoped to stage in the \"coming weeks and months\".And, more specifically, to demonstrate the \"central role\" Mr Brown will play in the election campaign, despite being sidelined as campaign chief in favour of Mr Milburn.But it was the former health secretary's final gesture, placing an arm on Mr Brown's back as they walked away from the microphones, which was perhaps the most telling.There was much forced smiling for the cameras, but only Mr Prescott, who revels in such occasions, seemed to be truly enjoying himself.The event was carefully stage-managed to underline Cabinet unity.It was left to Mr Prescott to pay glowing tribute to the chancellor's record and, in a final flourish, to produce his famous pledge card, from 1997, claiming Labour has met all of its promises.It was also one of the most bizarre photo opportunities of recent years.Mr Brown repeated the familiar mantras displayed on the posters and spoke of Labour's \"shared purpose\" and \"united dedication\".But the pair were all smiles on Tuesday morning, as they joined John Prescott to unveil Labour's latest poster campaign.If press reports are to be believed, Alan Milburn and Gordon Brown have been at each other's throats over the contents of Labour's next election manifesto.", "It claims Mr Blair said in November 2003 he would stand down as prime minister before the next election.Mr Peston's book claimed that Mr Brown told Mr Blair: \"There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe.\"Labour staged a show of unity at its own poster launch on Tuesday, where Mr Brown was joined by Alan Milburn, who Mr Blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor.The prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made Mr Peston's book.But Mr Blair dismissed the talk of splits and said people's priorities at the next elections would be on the economic successes achieved by Labour.But before doing so, he insisted he still trusted Mr Blair, despite claims to the contrary in a new book.Mr Blair directly denied that quote on Wednesday.Later at their poster launch Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said his party would exploit opportunities to show how \"juvenile\" the prime minister and chancellor were.Later this week Mr Blair is expected to outline the direction of his party's next election manifesto.Mr Blair said he would not respond to \"tittle tattle in books\" and promised to hail Labour's record on the economy, waiting lists and law and order \"from now until polling day\".", "And he tells them that if they don't confess - and they are the only one not to confess - they'll get life.He tells each prisoner separately, that if they confess - and they are the only one to confess - they'll be let off their crime.And if your partner does confess, you'd better confess to ensure you don't get life.In the case of an apparently endless argument, if you want it to come to an end, you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row.The result is of course, both prisoners confess, so the sheriff does not have to let either one off.The cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing, or one more book for that matter, has to exceed the benefit of having the last word, and getting your point in.Now, if you are prisoner confronted with this choice, your best bet is to confess.Both prisoners' individual logic was to behave that way, even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up.Their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on.If your partner doesn't confess, you'll get off completely.Each participant genuinely wants the row to stop, but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard.But the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them, to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime.And there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going.It's no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms, or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on.It's often referred to as the \"prisoner's dilemma\", based on a parable much told in economics degree courses... about a sheriff and two prisoners.", "There was little in terms of concrete proposals or what might form manifesto pledges, although the prime minister talked about a \"New Labour manifesto that will be aimed at all sections of society\".And there was an insistence on the importance of the party continuing to operate as unremittingly \"New\" Labour - although that may continue to irritate his chancellor.Under what is to be the general election slogan \"Britain is working\", the prime minister time and again insisted the future direction would be unremittingly New Labour.His was more a speech designed to remind people, and some in his own party, precisely what New Labour stood for, and to leave them in no doubt there would not be any shrinking away from that approach.An unremittingly \"New\" Labour manifesto, as the prime minister is happy to make plain, will stress the importance of that - the belief patients and parents, for example, want a choice of good services before they start worrying about who has provided them.The prime minister used his speech to a selected audience in the south east to set out his broad brush election manifesto.With an election looming the next big speech from Gordon Brown will be closely examined for any signs of divisions and, in particular, the use of that little three letter word.\"Home ownership extended to its

efficiency drive.\"The Conservatives are committed to cutting Labour's public spending plans by a massive \u00a335 billion,\" he said.The Tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people, rather than officials, run hospitals and surgeries.Plans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the Conservatives as part of their effort to show how government

rule of succession is regulated not only through descent and tradition but also by the Act of Settlement which confirmed in 1701 that it was for Parliament to determine the title to the throne.But he acknowledged that even if the bill did win support, it was unlikely to become law because the legislative programme is likely to be squeezed by the coming general election.He pointed out that it was 30 years since the sex discrimination act and urged politicians on all sides to back the bill.", "So why Britain and why UKIP which, despite its recent EU election successes, is not likely to pull off a sensational victory in the looming general election.UKIP's performance in last year's European elections was just such a shocker and showed that Mr Morris may have a point about the new consensus.The aim of UKIP is to withdraw from the EU and if it has any relation to the Tories it is to stiffen the Tories' spine on the issue by having a large enough UKIP vote so that we move the Tories in the direction they are refusing to move.\"Anything can happen in the next general election.So what is the big plan for the general election.But there is undoubtedly a sense that the next

small number of swing seats - just as he believes it will in Britain.So he is out to help UKIP take Britain out of this organisation which he believes is unreformable and inherently undemocratic.I think UKIP had a huge amount to do with Tony Blair's decision to hold a referendum on the European constitution and I think it had a huge amount to do with his refusal to go into the euro\".And he is scathing of the Tory party which he also appears to believe is unreformable.\"I was on a cruise in the Mediterranean and, coincidentally, so was UKIP leader Roger Knapman.And, while we are on the subject of Mr Kilroy-Silk, Mr Morris despatches him with another of his neat soundbites.On this subject, Morris appears almost evangelical.\"The internet was a decisive factor in the 2004 presidential election - through blogs (individuals posting their views in online diaries).But what is it about UKIP that particularly attracts him?Neither does UKIP have to fight every seat.But Morris is no ideologue.Many might think it is simply another chance to practice his art, irrespective of the politics.\"Labour and the Tories have drawn the consensus so tightly and to the left there is room for

he also praised Mr Brown as one of the leaders of the party's reform process.Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats' President Simon Hughes said: \"New Labour has lost people's confidence in a way Old Labour never did.\"Mr Milburn insisted that government reform must continue.\"Our task is to rebuild the New Labour coalition around 'one nation politics' that recognise, while life is hard for many,

party which will give value for money and tax less\".So it is a pretty safe bet to assume that, when Robert Jackson finally decided to jump ship and swim over to the Labour benches, his new masters decided to time the announcement for the greatest possible impact.The big idea is his \u00a335bn savings on waste and bureaucracy which Mr Howard has pledged to plough back into public services and tax cuts.\"The election is not going to be decided on what Robert Jackson did,\" he added.But Mr Howard announced that, of the \u00a335bn he has earmarked from savings, \u00a312bn will be used to plug

cuts agenda.With just about everyone in Westminster now working towards a May general election, Mr Howard is eager to map out some clear and distinctive policies aimed at finally shifting the Tories' resolutely depressing poll showings.Mr Howard knows that risks accusations that, as a result, he would slash public services, so he has attempted to shoot that fox first.Mr Howard, however, was

sensible, costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax, crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name.The gap between

he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts.Tory leader Michael Howard has said his party would cut \u00a335bn in \"wasteful\" spending to allow \u00a34bn in tax cuts.Mr Blair said: \"The Conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both Britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services.The Chancellor said the Conservatives' plans would see some \u00a350bn in spending cuts by 2011, which the Tories deny.Meanwhile, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr Blair of \"misrepresenting\" the party's proposals and questioned how Labour would fund its own plans.On Saturday, Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said the Tories would fund the cuts by removing \"inefficiencies\" which had \"burgeoned\" under Labour.The prime minister has told a Labour Party gathering that the Tory policies would cause economic failure.In response, David Davis said the Tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match Labour's spending on health and education.Mr Davis said Labour had been responsible for \"huge waste, huge overspending, not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy\".\"Once again Mr Blair and his Chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the \u00a38bn shortfall in their plans?\"", "With the other two big parties battling over which will impose the lowest taxes, Mr Kennedy is going into the looming election pledged to increase taxation.Once again, with the two other big parties singing similar songs on immigration, Mr Kennedy is stressing the different, more liberal approach of his party.But, unlike the old Tory-Labour debate, he believes voters are ready to see \"modest\" tax increases on the well off in order to fund improvements in services.The Tories claim they can improve services AND cut taxes through \u00a335bn efficiency savings, while Labour has offered \u00a322bn savings but has yet to map out precise tax proposals, although there is little chance they will propose increases.With his party's previous pledge to increase taxes by one penny in the pound to spend on public services already adopted by the government, he has switched tack.Mr Kennedy was also in buoyant mood over his party's election chances, declaring the Tories were not going to be \"significant players\" in the poll.Charles Kennedy has told voters his Liberal Democrats will offer them an \"honest choice\" at the next general election.Similarly there is a different tone to the Lib Dem approach to asylum and immigration, with Mr Kennedy stressing politicians should not \"foment an artificial debate\" about immigration and attacking Michael Howard's proposals for quotas.", "He also believes being the only major party promising to increases taxes will not land him in the same trouble a similar policy did to Old Labour.Mr Kennedy is also eager to dispel any impression his party is the new party of the left and is likely to attract mostly disillusioned Labour voters.\"This is really going to be the first modern three party UK election that we have all experienced\".Charles Kennedy is far too canny to make any grand claims about how his party may fare at the general election.Under a Labour government the tax burden would have to rise, while the Tories' plans to increase spending in some areas while also reducing taxes is just incredible, he claims.He is prepared to go this far: \"A clear conclusion has been reached, including by Conservatives, that the Conservatives are not going to win this election.\"I think the tax argument has moved on a lot in British politics particularly in the context of the forthcoming general election,\" he said.If, as expected, his party increases its showing at the election, he intends to go into the next parliament \"on the front foot with a view to leading it right through that parliament into the next election because I see that as the decisive opportunity for us\".That last remark reflects a view gaining ground in Westminster that, if the Tories do as badly as some fear, the election after next might really see that historic breakthrough by the third party.\"We are being straightforward with people, saying you know there is likely to be an increase in the tax burden, we are only recommending one specific tax rise for the top end of income scale earners to fund three specific policies\".\"Therefore the

who do not follow the correct teachings of Islam.Mr Forsyth has forgotten one key point; the terrorists who threaten Britain today are well aware that Hitler, Stalin, and the IRA all failed.The British government is a far greater threat that and terrorist organisation.The perpetuation of the perceived terrorist threat is not because of what the 'alleged' terrorists are doing, but from our own government.Like many of your respondents, I wouldn't usually think of Mr Forsyth as someone whose views I share, but in the instance of opposing Charles Clark's proposals for house arrest, I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth/  I agree with Mr Forsyth.The British Government is not going down the road that Mr Forsyth suggests.I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Forsyth.Sadly comments such as his will make a lot of people believe that they are governed by people who are fast becoming tyrants instead of being genuinely committed to stopping tyranny, even if the method employed to do that is at the moment alien to the British people who have lived in a democracy protected by Tony Blair and others of like mind who, Mr. Forsyth seems to be putting along side the 'scruffy little Austrian.'I do not usually agree with Mr. Forsyth, but he is spot on here.An interesting view but missing two crucial facts of this new threat: 1) If these terrorists acquire weapons of mass destruction they WILL use them without fear of Mutually Assured Destruction that kept the cold war in a state of tense balance.The threat now is new.I agree with Frederick Forsyth.As it stands terrorists do not need to attack the U.K. it's government will soon have it's people terrorised more that they could very achieve with a few bombs.I agree in many ways with what Mr Forsyth has said - if we are to be respected and have influence within the world we must be seen to be walking the walk as well as talking the talk - how can we accuse countries such as Zimbabwe and Burma of human rights abuses when we are locking up people who may be totally innocent, it is hypocrisy of the highest order.Mr Forsyth has done a good job in voicing his opinions.The Lord Chancellor has defended government plans to introduce control orders to keep foreign and British terrorist suspects under house arrest, where there isn't enough evidence to put them on trial.If the government has its way with ID cards, tracking and so on then totalitarianism has won and as such it then matters little whether we give in to the terrorists demands or not.People like Forsyth can only see one side of any argument and for him it is the side that is opposite New Labour and Tony Blair.I agree, the government is probably encouraging a degree of mass-hysteria and talking up the threat; but talking-down the threat and doing nothing is unacceptable too.We have coped with fear without becoming a state based on fear; we have coped with threat without turning our country into a land of state threat.I absolutely agree with Frederick Forsyth.Although, in principle I agree with him, Frederick Forsyth fails to address one key point- al-Qaeda attacks (though obviously there have been none yet in the UK) seek to kill the maximum number of people.Yes, there has been oppression by the British government in the past, and overstepping the mark in places like Ireland, but yes, we are still a democracy where it is rare to be arrested without charge/trial etc.In this overly 'politically correct' society, it is good to see someone like Mr. Forsyth speak out.Mr Forsyth has expressed exactly what my gut fears and reservations were about this proposed legislation, but could not verbalise.I'll bet any money you like that the day after any such attack Freddie Forsyth will be saying that the government didn't do enough to protect the UK.I am shocked at the ease with which this government is prepared to wipe out a major portion of the liberties that British people have enjoyed for centuries - the right not to be deprived of our liberty without a trial in open court.It is this fear which enables terrorists to succeed in the end, and terrorists can come in all forms, as Mr. Forsythe's opening comments suggest.The very reason this country has been such a wonderful place to live, is under attack, not from terrorists, but from this government.This government, with much fanfare, signs us up to the European Convention on Human Rights but now wants to introduce indefinite house arrest without trial.To be protected from terror the government says, we must become a tyranny.2) The terrorists are prepared to use suicide bombers which means they could kill innocent people on the London Underground and we could do very little to stop it.The threat today is that terrorists will acquire nuclear or biological technology.What is really worrying is the enthusiasm of Mr Blair and his government for authoritarian reactions and attempts to manipulate the electorate through fear.The problem I see is that those who support imprisonment without trial believe it will never happen to them or their family, only to people they don't like or are scared of.I agree with Mr Forsyth's views.I accept that the intentions of these policies are to make Britain a safer place but I cannot think of a single example from history where doing this sort of thing has ever made any difference - in Northern Ireland internment certainly didn't achieve anything - the bombings didn't stop, and it could be argued that all it achieved was to just supply the IRA with yet more angry and resentful republicans willing to take up arms against the British.The nature of the current threat is new.But in the 66 years that I have been alive, there has not been one hour, of one day, of one month, of one year, when there has not been a threat aimed at us.Yes, I agree with Mr. Forsyth's views.But to meet the new threat, to defeat the sinister fanaticism of today's terrorists, we may need to do things a little differently.Of course Frederick is wrong about Britain winning the war against the IRA and he's wrong too about the country not becoming a tyranny.Being eight years older than Frederick Forsyth and a survivor of the Blitz on London, it is easy to agree with him, he is absolutely spot on.)They were to place suspect terrorist under surveillance and maybe acquire sufficient evidence to prosecute or even better prevent a terrorist attack.It will be a little late in the day when people outside London wake up one morning to find out that London has been nuked.Forsyth says 3000 died over 30 years or terrorism; 3000 people died in one morning in NY on September 11th 2001.But that is what the Blair government now seeks to do - create a tyranny to defend us from the al-Qaeda tyranny.I never thought it possible for me to agree with a single word uttered by Frederick Forsyth, but I'm in wholehearted agreement with him on this one.I am slightly older than Mr Forsyth and therefore have lived through the same history as him.These laws and the emphasis on the Islamic threat will just do the same.Forsyth is wrong.If the government can hold 'suspects' without charge or trial, what's next?That does not mean that the civil liberties of modern Britain must be eroded to counter the threat; that should always be the absolute last resort.The government is seeking to introduce a police state.That goes right back to Magna Carta, and ordinary people have spilled their blood to enforce that right against governments who thought they \"knew best\".Mr Forsyth seems to forget that killings in the Troubles occurred on both sides of the religious divide and was carried out by killers from both sides.Like New Labour, he believed he was promoting the people's best interests.Just look at the facts - our government (along with the US) invaded another sovereign country (Iraq) by selecting intelligence that backed it's case based on fear.These people will use devastating force against us without fear of ANY consequence.Frederick Forsyth puts it beautifully.Terrorists intend to spread fear but in reality it is the government which has spread the fear, by its constant publicising of the this invisible enemy so dangerous that we must allow them to ride roughshod over our rights and liberties.The mortal threat back then was a scruffy little Austrian called Adolf Hitler.Mr Forsyth is a wonderful writer and should keep his fiction where it belongs.The governments approach is totally against the spirit of British democracy.I am against a police state and would not like to think that I lived in one.But history has shown that if you have laws like that, they always get abused by those in power.The single biggest threat we face is that of a government dedicated to acting illegally and manipulating international and national law to suit its own purpose.Now the threat is Islamic fundamentalism.I don't usually have much time for Mr Forsyth's largely right wing views but this time he has got it spot on.It is Frederick Forsyth who is the extremist, because he does not appreciate the need for balance.This government seeks to balance protection of our democracy with minimum loss of civil rights.The problem with this issue is not that it isn't important, but the fact that in general we Brits can be so politically apathetic some times, that we will just let this go without telling the government no.The citizen can be arrested and held without charge or trial, not even on the careful consideration of an experienced judge, but the whim of a political activist called a government minister.Now the Blair government proposes the law system of fascism and communism.At this time, let us not forget, suspects (foreign and British were routinely rounded up and interned for the duration of the war, without any complaints from the public.The new powers of home internment without trial follow a pattern which includes the introduction of surveillance via compulsory ID cards and the linking of data bases, together with the un-British idea that we will have to swear allegiance to the state at the age of 18 years.If we imprison people without trial for an indeterminate period, we are no better that those we are fighting.Because these terrorists are potentially SO deadly, we have to come up with new, tougher responses.The idea that the \"new terrorism\" demands new powers is erroneous.You now have a combination of people who will perform terrorist acts with technology that is rapidly becoming accessible.However, as the nation that gave the world the common law and a true sense of the rights of individual liberty I hope this will prove to be one step too far.It is based and funded abroad; so was the IRA.This puts it on a par with the government of Burma.Thirty more years; 300 policemen and women, over 600 soldiers, more than 3,000 civilians dead, but we won because even IRA bombs could not force us to become a tyranny.The terrorists have already won.Like New Labour, he called himself a libertarian.(apart from a number of prisoners in Belmarsh goal, for example).This country signs up to human rights, and then pretends that they only apply to the people with nothing to fear, the innocent people (defined by whom?).Surely we the public would be better protected if the security services, rather than alerting a suspect terrorist by placing them under house arrest (and for how long?And without becoming a tyranny.When you look at today's Britain, you realise George Orwell was only wrong about one thing: the date.But as Forsythe criticises this government, Hobbes has been criticised by most subsequent philosophers for arguing his way into the hands of the totalitarians.It has sleeper fanatics inside our society; so did the IRA.Just because a person may have made some stupid and naive decisions in life does not make them a terrorist.You cannot compare the threats of past years with now.Our freedom is being craftily and surreptitiously whittled away by this government and we are gaining nothing.I agree.If they do not have evidence to bring these people to trial, there probably isn't any.Lord Falconer insists that the proposals do not equate to a police state and strike a balance between protecting the public against the threat of terrorism and upholding civil liberties.", "Both unions are remaining tight-lipped about the

was cheaper than using tanks, a new documentary has revealed.Asked by the documentary makers why he had lied about his leadership ambitions, Mr Kilroy-Silk said: \"There was one thing I said that I

justification.He says he was not \"German-bashing\" but saying peace was the EU's founding aim.The documentary showed some of the tensions between Mr Kilroy-Silk and his fellow MEPs after UKIP took third place in last year's European elections.He did not defend other groups' religious beliefs but argued it was their right to hold such views - just as Mr Kilroy-Silk had a right to criticise Arab states.A UKIP spokesman said there were more than 40 MEPs in the same group in the European Parliament.", "\"He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [European] election it

has not been \"straightforward\" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.Mr Hockney also left UKIP saying Mr Kilroy-Silk would \"deliver better\" as the leader of a Eurosceptic party.Good luck to Kilroy though I think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and UKIP because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment UKIP have the upper hand while Veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle.Mr Kilroy-Silk quit UKIP last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party.Thank goodness that Kilroy-Silk has gone - now UKIP at least has a chance in the election!Let's hope Kilroy-Silk, UKIP and the euro-sceptic wing of the Tory Party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about Europe.Mr Kilroy-Silk, who recently quit the UK Independence Party, said \"our country\" was being \"stolen from us\" by mass immigration.I think Mr Kilroy-Silk has got a very good point.Kilroy-Silk was made an MEP because of his position on the UKIP's party list.The sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better  Does anyone else think that it is ironic that Euro-Sceptic Kilroy-Silk has used a Latin name for his new party, rather than a 'good old British' name?\"While UKIP has turned its back on the British people, I shall not,\" he said.Hopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue.Ex-BBC chat show host and East Midlands MEP Robert Kilroy-Silk said he wanted to \"change the face of British politics\" as he launched his new party.Good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done.Man with tan leaves party with no plan, to set up party with no idea.The electorate of the East Midlands voted not for Kilroy-Silk but for the UKIP.Its leader, Roger Knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.This Kilroy-Silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party.UKIP leader Roger Knapman says he is glad to see the back of Mr Kilroy-Silk.As the main Eurosceptic party, UKIP should try to resolve its differences with Kilroy to show a united front and give the UK public a serious political voice against Europe.It's all well and good Robert Kilroy-Silk claiming, that 'Veritas' is a party that doesn't believe in \"lies and spin\", but the truth of the matter is, its completely useless, due to proportional representation, there is no chance that 'Veritas' will have any chance in claiming power, and change the two-horse race trend.Veritas is the beginning of the end for Kilroy-Silk.This new party seems a logical next step for Kilroy.UKIP's chairman Petrina Holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.Brilliant, about time this country had a plausible party!It's all flash and no real policy here  Let's hope this is the start of both UKIP and Kilroy-Silk slipping into obscurity.Whilst not being a great fan of Kilroy I do agree with his comments about the UKIP leadership, and like him I am also leaving UKIP.Having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.The party asserts that Mr Hockney \"has a moral obligation, if not a legal one\" to stand down.Robert Kilroy-Silk could have a lot to offer.Kilroy-Silk may just have those very qualities.UKIP has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the EU.Whatever Kilroy-Silk and UKIP do, none of their anti-European policies have any relevance outside middle England.Instead we have a split party and a damaged cause.Kilroy has one agenda - the UK - and I'll be voting for him.If Mr Kilroy-Silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote.On Thursday Mr Kilroy-Silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon's Ashfield seat.Mr Kilroy-Silk promised a \"firm but fair\" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election.Having seen the recent BBC 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior UKIP figures I can well understand why Kilroy-Silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people.He said he was ashamed to be a member of a UKIP whose leadership had \"gone AWOL\" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last June's European elections.Interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a Latin name!Last summer, UKIP achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to Kilroy-Silk.UKIP tried hard to accommodate Robert Kilroy Silk, but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him.British politics has become too PC and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians.I wouldn't write off Kilroy-Silk.The very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as Euroscepticism or British Supremacy is nauseating.Under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation.Kilroy Silk has secured my vote, and many more like me.Kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician, in exactly the way those who lead UKIP are not.Kilroy-Silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue.He was joined in the new venture by one of UKIP's two London Assembly members, Damien Hockney who is now Veritas' deputy leader.If he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.So UKIP was good enough for him to lead, not good enough for him to follow!", "BBC correspondent Stephen Cape said the combined unions represented \"a formidable force\" which could embarrass the government in the run-up to

said.\"They are turned off by the way we do politics in Britain.", "\"After that Downing Street proceeded to set out his [Lord Goldsmith's] view in a parliamentary answer which was then published on 17 March,\" said Mr Sands.Downing Street has denied the claims, made in a new book about the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith's advice.But a short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action.In a statement to Newsnight, Lord Goldsmith said: \"In my parliamentary answer on March 17 2003, I explained my genuinely held independent view, that military action was lawful under the existing Security Council resolutions.This would be wrong even if Lord Goldsmith had signed the statement, Mr Cook said, because the attorney general's advice should be an \"independent legal opinion\", not subject to \"political negotiation of this kind\".Lord Goldsmith also denied them, saying he was not \"leaned on\" in any way.The government has consistently refused to publish Lord Goldsmith's advice on the legality of the war - saying such papers have always been kept confidential.The Tories say ministers must respond in Parliament to claims that the legal advice used to justify the Iraq war was drawn up at Number 10.Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell repeated his party's calls for Lord Goldsmith's first piece of legal advice to be made public.But the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say they want the publication of the full legal advice given by the Attorney General.", "Mr Hockney said the law was clear that those elected on a list who quit their party should keep their seats.\"The Greater London Act is clear that if someone resigns who was elected on a list, their party whip the seat belongs to them and not the party.\"He said Mr Hulme-Cross and himself had no intention of resigning and added that they felt that it was UKIP who were not being true to the electorate.The party argues the pair should give up their seats as they won them as UKIP representatives, not as individuals.She said: \"The party has taken legal advice and it is clear that we could take legal proceedings against you which could result in the return of our seats and/or damages against you.Veritas was formed by Mr Kilroy-Silk earlier this month after he quit UKIP following an unsuccessful bid to take over as leader.", "The prime minister claims this is the clearest indication that it is the Tories who are playing politics with the issue by attempting to score cheap political points in parliament.He didn't say so, but the Tories believe the prime minister is playing the fear card on this one so he can look tough in the run up to the general election And they believe Tony Blair is using the issue to suggest the Tories are soft on terrorism.Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy avoided suggesting anyone was playing politics with the issue.So who, if anyone, is playing politics with the security of the nation?As is his habit nowadays, the prime minister was less rough with Mr Kennedy than he had been with Mr Howard - he prefers a more exasperated tone suggesting he believes the Lib Dems have, once again, just missed the point.The prime minister almost blushed.Why on earth will the prime minister not simply take up the Tories' offer to extend the existing powers temporarily to allow proper parliamentary debate of the laws, he demanded.Michael Howard has no doubt it is the prime minister who, he claims, is \"ramming\" through Parliament the controversial new anti-terror measures without proper debate.", "Former minister Clare Short, who resigned from the government over the Iraq war, said the ministerial answer was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action.Former foreign secretary Robin Cook said Lord Goldsmith's admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested Parliament may have been misled.In a statement, Lord Goldsmith said: \"I was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised, and of course approved, the answer.\"He added the answer represented his view that the war was legal, but was not a summary of his advice to the PM.Lord Goldsmith said Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan played no part in drafting the answer.\"The attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary, but others certainly did,\" he said.\"If his original advice of 7 March accepted that military action might be illegal, how was it that he resolved any such doubts by the time the Parliamentary answer was published on 17 March?\"Earlier, Tony Blair dismissed questions about the attorney general's advice, and said his Parliamentary statement had been a \"fair summary\" of his opinion.he said.\"The answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government.\"\"As I have always made clear, I set out in the answer my own genuinely held, independent view that military action was lawful under the existing (UN) Security Council resolutions,\" he said.A short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action - did not suggest this.He said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of Solicitor General Harriet Harman, two of his own officials, three Foreign Office officials, a QC, Christopher Greenwood and the then Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg.", "Lord Goldsmith said the answer represented his \"genuinely held independent view\" the war was legal.Former foreign secretary Robin Cook said Lord Goldsmith's admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested Parliament may have been misled.\"The attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary, but others certainly did,\" he said.Last week Lord Goldsmith said in a statement: \"I was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised, and of course approved, the answer.\"In the House of Lords, the attorney general faced a call by former Tory lord chancellor Lord Mackay to now publish the \"full text\" of the advice - the suggestion was rejected.Tony Blair has dismissed questions about the attorney general's advice, and said his Parliamentary statement had been a \"fair summary\" of his opinion.\"The answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government.\"\"As I have always made clear, I set out in the answer my own genuinely held, independent view that military action was lawful under the existing (UN) Security Council resolutions,\" he said.Another peer meanwhile, Lord Skidelsky, said not to publish the full legal opinion would \"strengthen the suspicion that the the original text was doctored for public consumption, in exactly the same way as the notorious intelligence dossier on weapons of mass destruction\".A short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action - did not suggest this.He said the answer had been prepared in his office with

Howard appointed Mr Crosby as his elections chief last October.Mr Crosby's statement said: \"The Conservative Party has been making an impact on the issues of lower tax and controlled immigration over the past week.\"Mr Howard later added there was not \"one iota\" of truth in the report.But Mr Crosby said in a statement: \"I have never had any such conversation... and I do not hold that view.\"", "The Labour Party will hold its 2006 autumn conference in Manchester and not Blackpool, it has been confirmed.For years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton.In 1998 the party said it would not return to Blackpool but did so in 2002.And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort.Colin Asplin, Blackpool Hotel Association said: \"We have tried very hard to make sure they come back to Blackpool.It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event.", "Labour has been accused of using anti-Semitic images in posters which critics claim depict Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin.Mr Howard did not comment on the anti-Semitism claims when asked about the poster on Monday.The image simply portrayed Mr Howard as a hypnotist, he argued.Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp said the poster had been misunderstood.The poster shows Mr Howard hypnotising people with a pocket watch, saying: \"I can spend the same money twice.\"It showed Mr Howard and Mr Letwin - who are both Jewish - as flying pigs.Mr Howard told Greater Manchester Radio: \"It is such a pity that Mr Blair doesn't practise what he preaches.\"A Labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the party's website was not affected by the row.There was controversy over another poster choice offered to Labour members.Jewish Chronicle editor Ned Temko said there had been a mixed reaction to the first poster but e-mails from Jewish Chronicle readers showed deeper concern about the hypnotism image.", "A Labour spokesman later said their removal from the party's website was not affected by the row.Labour's election chief Alan Milburn has defended his party's campaign posters amid Tory claims the ads were nothing short of \"sly anti-Semitism\".The Fagin and pigs might fly posters were taken off Labour's website on Monday after supporters voted for their favourite poster featuring Mr Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin holding a blackboard reading 2+2=5.The posters were among a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who were asked to vote on their favourite.Labour has withdrawn two controversial posters and launched four new designs.The posters were among a series of ideas shown to Labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election.In the Commons, Tory spokesman Mr Lewis suggested the posters were part of a wider trend and reminded MPs that Labour

parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue, there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before.Labour has already branded the proposal unworkable but party strategists have seen the Tories seizing a poll advantage over the issue.Former union leader Sir Bill Morris has already accused both the big parties of engaging in a \"bidding war about who can be nastiest to asylum seekers\".The challenge for the big parties is to ensure they can engage in the debate during the cut and thrust of a general election while also avoiding that trap.That has been attacked by the Tories as too little, too late and for failing to tackle the key issue of the numbers entering the UK.That was also true at the last general election and the issue did briefly become a campaigning issue.", "The Liberal Democrats say in the northern cities, the race is between them and Labour, while in southern seats - particularly the south west - it is between them and the Tories.Mr Kennedy said the British public felt let down by Labour on issues from Iraq to top-up fees and the Conservatives were not \"asking the critical questions\".Mr Kennedy's tour comes as he, Labour leader Tony Blair and Conservative leader Michael Howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next General Election, widely expected to be held on 5 May.On Tuesday Mr Kennedy will visit Leicester South, where Lib Dem MP Parmjit Singh Gill overturned a big Labour majority to win the seat in last year's by-election.Asked whether it was realistic to assume the Liberal Democrats could win the general election, he said: \"There's no limit to the ambitions we have as a party.Speaking to the BBC's Westminster Hour on Sunday, Mr Kennedy said the upcoming general election - widely tipped for 5 May - would be much more unpredictable than any others in \"recent experience\".And he said people were \"highly sceptical\" about Labour and Conservative promises on tax.", "Mr Telford agreed, but added it was becoming increasingly difficult to think of an answer when people asked \"What has Labour done for the North East?\"Katrina Bull, a prospective parliamentary candidate said Mr Blair had shown he could rouse the party's grassroots: \"I think if every voter was able to spend time in a room with Tony, the way we have today, we will have no problem with turnout.\"A party of councillors from Nottingham agreed that there was nothing wrong with Mr Blair's leadership - and they were adamant that the campaigning strength of the party in their city was as strong as ever.The problem they faced, they said, was converting this local feelgood factor into votes.Every activist I spoke to said they were proud of what they believed Labour had achieved in their local communities - the new hospitals and schools, the better life chances for young people.Stephen Douglas, 26, from Wales, said after the PM's speech on Sunday: \"I think it was a bit of a turning point, given the roasting he has had on some issues.But for every Brownite at the spring conference there was an equally ardent fan of Mr Blair.The problem, according to Mr Lane, is not continuing divisions over Iraq, foundation hospitals or tuition fees, or even voter apathy, but Mr Blair himself.Tony Martin, of Burnley, said: \"He is the first leader who has won us two terms.We are up for this election,\" said Richie Porterhouse.Tony Blair has told Labour supporters he's \"back\" and still hungry for the job of prime minister - but does that sum up the mood at the party's spring conference in Gateshead?But when asked about Mr Blair's bravura performance on Friday, the men agreed he was \"brilliant\".\"It might sound great, but it does create this sense of complacency among our own voters and I think that is the greater problem than Iraq,\" said Nottingham City Councillor Brian Parbutt.And they would all be out on the doorstep pushing the Labour message come election time.\"The electorate are keener on the government than some Labour Party members,\" is the dry assessment of Graham Lane, leader of the Labour group on Newham Council.I think we have all felt a little jaded, but it reminded us why we joined the party in the first place,\" said Mrs Spence.Malcolm Shipley, of Shipley, said it was \"as if he is coming round to the right approach again\".", "Assistant information commissioner Phil Jones said it was classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them.Mr Taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring TPS numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.\"If a party is calling someone who is registered on TPS and records their voting intention with a view to using this information in the future, this should be clear to the voter concerned,\" said Mr Jones.\"When we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not,\" he said.A Conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang TPS subscribers.He said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no, they were not rung again.\"If a party rings a person who is registered on TPS to ask about their voting intention and goes on to encourage that voter to support them, the party may well be in breach of the regulations.The parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people's voting intentions.A Labour Party spokesman told the BBC News website the party avoided those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising.But seven million telephone numbers are on the Telephone Preference Service (TPS) lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls.She said: \"We do apply TPS but in line with the law.", "Labour say a Lib Dem vote could \"let the Tories in\", while the Tories say the Lib Dems would mean \"higher taxes, soft crime laws, more power to Europe\".People vulnerable to problem debts should be afforded greater protection from banks aggressively promoting financial products, the Lib Dems say.Speaking to the BBC's Westminster Hour on Sunday, Mr Kennedy said the upcoming general election - widely tipped for 5 May - would be much more unpredictable than any others in \"recent experience\".Mr Cable said the government's Consumer Credit Bill would target some of the \"extreme problems\" such as loan sharking, but ministers had been \"a bit complacent\" about the wider issue of debt levels.Mr Kennedy's tour comes as he, Labour leader Tony Blair and Conservative leader Michael Howard all step up campaigning ahead of the next General Election, widely expected to be held on 5 May.The Liberal Democrats say in the northern cities, the race is between them and Labour, while in southern seats - particularly the south west - it is between them and the Tories.Mr Kennedy is visiting a mixture of rural seats, where his party is hoping to make gains from the Conservatives, and urban areas traditionally associated with Labour.And he brushed off Labour suggestions a vote for his party would mean letting the Tories in \"by the back door\".", "The Lib Dems say their \"mutual homes\" would let people buy a share of a property, usually worth about 5% of the building costs.The party's scheme would allow people to buy a share in a home through a mutual home ownership trust, as a way of getting onto the housing ladder.Mr Hill said he also asked whether the Lib Dems would match Labour's promise to spend \u00a342bn on making refurbishing and repair council homes by 2010.Party leader Charles Kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land, donated by central or local government.It would also allow councils to vary discounts to tenants given the right to buy their council homes so local needs were taken into account.Labour has said it will allow 300,000 council and housing association tenants to buy a share in their homes.People would also only have to pay for the cost of the building and not the land, he added.There are also plans to prevent high house prices forcing people out of their local communities.The Lib Dems would also encourage the conversion of existing buildings in an effort to protect greenfield sites.They would spend about 30% of their monthly salary on rent and buying extra shares in the property.When they moved house, they would be able to cash in on any rise in property prices by selling their share.", "Mr Kennedy also believes the party's plans to use the money saved from not introducing \"illiberal\" ID cards to boost police numbers by 10,000 would appeal to women too.Both Labour and the Conservatives have said they also plan to boost pensions and to improve childcare support.The Conservatives are yet to unveil their manifesto plans for childcare but said in November they would increase maternity pay and pay the child tax credit in cash to parents to spend as they like, on a nanny, au pair or even a family member, such as a grandparent, acting as a carer.The Lib Dem's Citizen's Pension, based on length of residency not on national insurance contributions, would address that imbalance, Mr Kennedy argues.Mr Kennedy also points to the fact that 40% of the party's candidates set to stand in winnable or target seats are women.Mr Kennedy says he wants to deal with policy areas that disadvantage women.Labour's deputy minister for women Jacqui Smith accused the Lib Dems of offering \"false promises\" to women and said their sums did not add up.He says that pensions based on the number of years worked ignore the contribution women make caring for children.During the interview Mr Kennedy revealed that he planned to structure the party's general election campaign around the birth of his first child, which is expected in April.She said: \"These proposals would increase the costs to the public purse drastically year on year, and hard working families will pay dearly, through either increased taxes or reduced spending on public services\".", "Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy has said voters now have a \"fundamental lack of trust\" of Tony Blair as prime minister.He said backing his party was not a wasted vote, adding that with the Lib Dems \"what you see is what you get\".But he said Mr Blair had lost the trust of the British people.\"There is a fundamental lack of trust in Tony Blair as prime minister and in his government,\" he said.Mr Kennedy said during his nearly 22 years in Parliament he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of British politics.Mr Blair has already spent a day with Five and Michael Howard is booked for a similar session.", "BBC political editor Andrew Marr said that Mr Brown's article was \"a warning shot\" to Mr Blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process.Mr Blair argued that under New Labour the country had changed for the better and that was \"in part\" because of Mr Brown's management of the economy.Mr Blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor's role would be \"central\".The prime minister was asked about Mr Brown's article and about his election role when he appeared on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.The premier insisted Mr Brown will have a key role in Labour's campaign, and praised his handling of the economy.Mr Blair said he was taking \"nothing for granted\" ahead of the vote - warning that the Tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut Labour's majority instead of hoping for an outright win.", "Veteran Labour MP and former Cabinet minister Jack Cunningham has said he will stand down at the next election.Mr Blair said he was a \"huge figure\" in Labour and a \"valued, personal friend\".One of the few Blair-era ministers to serve under Jim Callaghan, he was given the agriculture portfolio when Labour regained power in 1997.Mr Cunningham went on to become Tony Blair's \"cabinet enforcer\".", "It is a move back towards an almost traditional Tory message which previously suggested Labour was the party of tax rises and the Conservatives the party of tax cuts.Ideas already floated include raising tax thresholds and abolishing or reducing inheritance tax, although some in the Tory party are urging Mr Howard to announce something more eye-catching before the election.And even after that was done, it would still have enough left over for a tax cut equivalent to about a penny off the basic rate of income tax.\"At this election, people will have a clear choice between Mr Blair who will waste more and tax more and the Conservative party which will give value for money and tax less,\" he said.Michael Howard has finally revealed the full scale of his planned Tory tax cuts.Of that, \u00a323 billion would go on spending plans, with \u00a38 billion to fill the black hole left, they claim, by Gordon Brown, and the rest going in tax cuts.Should he win the next general election, he has earmarked \u00a34 billion that will be used to reduce taxes - although he still will not say which or how.The extension of that, however, was that Labour was also seen as the party of big spending on the public services while the Tories were the cutters.So far that has not faced any real challenge, but independent analysts now claim a third New Labour government would be forced to either increase taxation or taxes to plug a black hole it has at the centre of its finances.", "The Votes at 16 alliance said it was a good thing to \"engage people\" by lowering the candidacy age but argued lowering the voting age would be much more effective.That is because the age of majority was reduced to 18 in 1969 but laws dating from 1695 which determine the current voting age stayed in place.The commission found the most common approach around the world is for the voting age to be the same as the candidacy age.\"The government intends to legislate, when parliamentary time allows, to lower the age,\" said Mr Leslie, who was elected in 1997 at the age of 24.The announcement from Mr Leslie - who was elected in 1997 in a formerly safe Tory seat - prompted calls for a lowering of the voting age to 16.Last April's report by the Electoral Commission said there was no strong argument for leaving the age for standing for election at 21.The voting age affects millions of younger people,\" said spokesman Alex Folkes.", "And Tony Blair would be in the very front line of that campaign, he said.Mr Milburn, in the latest in his series of pre-election-campaign campaigning, explained the slogan was the reaction to polling which suggests the public believe Labour and Tony Blair are the future while Michael Howard and the Tories would take the country backwards.It would be an aggressive campaign because things would inevitably boil down to a choice between Labour and the Tories.The word \"Britain\" is cast on a red background - a nod to Old Labour.They could, however, picture Michael Howard or, of course, Tony Blair doing it.And, coincidentally, the ad men who came up with the abandoned flying pigs and so-called \"Fagin\" posters which caused Tory protests have not been sacked but, as election supremo Alan Milburn declared, \"are doing a very good job\".Labour has unveiled the four little words that will form the heart of its general election campaign which, for those just returned from the planet Galifray, is \"looming\".The slogan \"Britain forward not back\" (no, it's not an instruction from one of those inter-planetary Time Lords) is to become as much a part of our daily lives as the sky - it's always there but we mostly stop noticing.", "Outlining his crime manifesto, Mr Howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates.Mr Howard said the authorities were not \"providing the local accountability that we want to see\" and that elected police commissioners would be more visible.Party leader Michael Howard said the new role would replace \"inconspicuous\" police authorities.Mr Oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a \"minimum policing guarantee\" with their chief constables.Local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner, under plans unveiled by the Conservatives.He said: \"Today the Tories are making more extravagant promises on the police without making clear how they would pay for them, other than through fantasy savings to the asylum system.\"Lord Harris, who sits on the executive of Association of Police Authorities, said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician.He said the new office would not supersede the job of a chief constable.", "If Mr Blair did not want to take part, the broadcasters could go ahead with an empty chair or cancel the event and explain their reasons why, Lord Holme said.Lord Holme, who has campaigned for televised debates at previous elections, said broadcasters were \"more than willing to cooperate with the arrangements\".\"What makes the present situation even less acceptable is that although Mr Howard and Mr Kennedy have said they would welcome a debate, no-one has heard directly from the prime minister,\" he said.\"It would be up to each party leader to accept or refuse,\" said Lord Holme.\"The broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead,\" he said.Lord Holme argued that as part of their public service obligations, broadcasters \"should make the decision to go ahead\" as soon as the election is called.It would then be up to Tony Blair, Michael Howard and Charles Kennedy to decide whether to take part, the non-partisan charity said.Tony Blair has already ruled out taking part in a televised debate during the forthcoming election campaign.", "Responding to the speech, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, George Osborne, said: \"This was more talk from Gordon Brown.\"There will be a simple choice at the election - value for money and lower taxes with the Conservatives, or more waste and higher taxes under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.\"The chancellor said the poll - expected to fall on 5 May - would give a \"clear and fundamental\" choice between Labour investment and Tory cuts.Laying into the Conservative's record in government he said: \"I give you this promise - with Labour, Britain will never return to the mistakes of ERM and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, \u00a33bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed.Liberal Democrat shadow chancellor Vince Cable warned the picture was not as rosy as Mr Brown would like to portray it.\"For all his trumpeting of Labour's management of the economy, Gordon Brown's record is very mixed,\" he said.Gordon Brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters, warning the \"stakes are too high\" to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election.To a packed audience at Gateshead's Sage Centre, Mr Brown accused shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, GP and nurse in the country.Mr Blair told the audience he believed the Iraq war would have made Britain a safer place if its emerging democracy succeeded and that he wanted to bring troops home as soon as possible, but not before the job was done.He also said he wanted to carry on as PM \"because I still think that there are big changes our country needs\".\"For all his positive words, Gordon Brown is faced with economic problems looming on the horizon, not least the unprecedented levels of personal debt facing the nation.\"", "Analysing Mr Brown's position before the speech, BBC correspondent James Hardy said Mr Brown would draw \"sharp dividing lines\" with the Conservatives for the forthcoming election campaign.Mr Blair has \"the same passion and the same commitments for the job\" as when Labour came to power in 1997, he said.The Conservatives and Lib Dems said the pledges - set to underpin Labour's election campaign - were \"worthless\".On Friday night, Mr Brown confirmed he would not make any tax commitments until the Labour manifesto had been published after the Budget, expected in March.Gordon Brown has delivered a rousing speech to Labour's spring conference setting out the government's agenda for the next general election.The chancellor said he was proud of his party's record on the economy, and would strive for continuing stability if elected.\"Mr Brown will lay out his credentials as a reforming chancellor determined to take on and beat the Asian tiger economies which increasingly dominate world trade,\" our correspondent said.He said: \"I'm the General Election co-ordinator and I don't know, and Tony has not made up his mind.\"The prime minister's enthusiasm for the job remains undimmed, Alan Milburn, Labour's election strategist told Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday.", "Mr Blair said that whether the public chose Michael Howard or Mr Kennedy, it would result in \"a Tory government not a Labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward\".Tory co-chairman Liam Fox was speaking after Mr Blair told Labour members the Tories offered a \"hard right agenda\".Dr Fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid \u00a3500,000 to former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election.The Lib Dems accuse Mr Blair of making a \"touchy-feely\" speech to Labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust.The Tory co-chairman attacked Labour's six new pledges as \"vacuous\" and said Mr Blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver.Dr Fox accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents' policies and then attacking the lies.In what was seen as a highly personal speech in Gateshead on Sunday, Mr Blair said: \"I have the same passion and hunger as when I first walked through the door of 10 Downing Street.\"Meanwhile Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy is expected to attack Mr Blair's words as he begins a nationwide tour on Monday.He would not discuss reports the party repaid \u00a3500,000 to Lord Ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat.", "The pledge on education - \"your child achieving more\" - was one of six election pledges unveiled by Mr Blair last week.Mr Blair later stressed Labour's election pledge to focus on education, when he met parents in the area.The prime minister has donned a life jacket and joined school children in a sailing dinghy as he sought to sell his party's education policies.\"What we're doing is introducing some simple guidelines so if teachers follow those they are not going to be at risk of legal action,\" Mr Blair said.Parents and teachers who met Mr Blair on Tuesday were invited to the informal discussion after writing to their MPs to raise concerns about education.\"You can't have a situation where parents or teachers end up being worried that they're going to be subject to all sorts of legal action if they take children sailing or doing outdoor activity that is actually good for the kids and good for their health and their character.\"Mr Blair, looking a little windswept, joined two girls from St Egwin's Middle School in Evesham and an instructor for a trip in the Wayfarer dinghy, closely followed by a boat full of photographers.Afterwards he said outdoor activities were beneficial for children but accepted that lots of teachers now worried about taking part for fear of being sued if something went wrong.", "Mr Blair used the tactic before the Iraq war to try to show he really was engaging with public concerns and you can expect to see it much more in the run-up to the election.I  was  prime minister and I wanted a flesh and blood fight,\" says Mr Major.He called it his \"masochism strategy\" in the run-up to the Iraq war and now Tony Blair has signed up for another dose of pain.Mr Blair told prospective Labour MPs on Thursday that taking part in phone-ins and public meetings could \"enthuse and engage and give the public a sense of empowerment\".Tony Blair himself has said people complain he does not listen.But it was seen as one of the few moments when that election campaign came alive, not least because it coincided with John Prescott's even more direct contact - when he punched an egg-throwing protester.Former prime ministers too have come to grief at the hands of a persistent member of the public.Mr Blair recalls how Bill Clinton once advised him: \"Always remember that what people see of you in the news in the evening is how they think you spend your day.\"Mr Blair tried to use the questioners' first names - and sometimes threw them off their stride by asking what they would do about the problems.Indeed there is a danger Mr Blair simply ends up looking \"embattled\".\"All you do is walk around and make yourself known, you don't do anything to help anybody,\" she told Mr Blair before stomping off, refusing his pleas to discuss the issue privately.A few \"don't worries\" as Mrs Hutchings was led back to the audience averted a public slanging match - he spoke to her privately after the show.The undoubted highlight of years of election phone-in shows was Margaret Thatcher discomfort on Nationwide in 1983, when viewer Diana Gould put her on the spot about the sinking of the Belgrano in the Falklands War.The idea is simple - the prime minister goes head to head with an often hostile group of \"real\" voters in the full spotlight of the television cameras.\"He wanted to look like a prime minister.The prime

of two things: the Budget will contain measures to attract votes, and it will not contain the \u00a38 billion of tax rises which independent experts say are inevitable if Labour wins the election.\"The Budget, likely to be the last before the General Election, will be at about 1230 GMT on that Wednesday, just after Prime Minister's question time.The Tories say it is likely the Budget will contain measures to attract votes.", "Mr Cable said 40% of all pensioners were now paying marginal tax rates of 50%.It was because he had rejected previous Lib Dem proposals, such as scrapping the New Deal, that Britain's economy was successful, claimed Mr Brown.Mr Cable said people did not know whether to believe the chancellor or the consensus among experts which said the rule would be broken.Mr Brown earmarked \u00a31bn to help keep down council tax rises next year.Mr Cable also accused the chancellor of ducking tough choices.Mr Brown confirmed he was setting aside another \u00a3520m for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.Lib Dem spokesman Vince Cable said the public did not know who to believe and the National Audit Office should judge.With that record, he asked why ministers attacked Lib Dem plans for a new 50% tax rate for the \"very rich\" - those earning more than \u00a3100,000 a year.Responding to the pre-Budget report, Mr Cable also attacked Labour's \"unfair\" and over-complicated taxes.Public trust in the handling of the economy can only be restored if Gordon Brown opens up his books for unbiased inspection, say the Lib Dems.In response, Mr Brown stressed the Iraq money came from a reserve funds.", "Mr Blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the \"cornerstone\" of Labour's programme.Mr Brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.Mr Brown insisted his spending plans were \"affordable\" and he could afford to be optimistic because Britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising.All of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all,\" Mr Blair said.In his pre-Budget report, Mr Brown surprised some City experts by forecasting UK growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year.In a speech at Edinburgh's Napier University, he said Labour would publish over the next few months \"a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term\".\"It is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending,\" Mr Cable told MPs.Tony Blair has backed Chancellor Gordon Brown's pre-Budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the UK economy.Conservative Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: \"I can't find a single economic forecaster from the IMF to the Institute of Fiscal Studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances.", "But he said local

negotiations with Turkey about possible EU membership although that there would be no prospect of a date for joining for some time.New European commission president Jose Manuel Barroso has suggested the cash could be shared out among net contributors to the EU budget.Mr Straw acknowledged some countries in the newly enlarged 25 nation EU still had to \"see the light\" on the rebate.", "But Mr Balls, a prospective Labour MP, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules.During an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Balls said he was sure Mr Brown's Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy.Mr Balls refused to say whether Mr Brown would remain as chancellor after the election, amid speculation he will be offered the job of Foreign Secretary.Mr Balls, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr Brown would meet his golden economic rule - \"with a margin to spare\".\"We would say to him 'don't increase your public spending, don't give it away.Ed Balls, ex-chief economic adviser to the Treasury, said there would be no spending spree before polling day.He also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning.\"If the MPC (the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I'm not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,\" he told a Parliamentary lunch.\"I think that Gordon Brown wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards,\" Mr Balls told Today.His assurances came after Sir Digby Jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers' skills.", "Mr Brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election, should Labour win.That is the size of the financial \"black hole\" the Tories, backed by some independent forecasters, believe Mr Brown will have to fill with tax increases after the election.The opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound, increase spending and cut taxes at the same time.The Liberal Democrats will also promise to run a sound economy, but based on increased taxes to fund spending and, amongst other things, abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax.The opening shot in that battle was fired at the weekend with claims a Treasury leak suggested Mr Brown was ready to slap capital gains tax on home sales to raise some of that cash.And, needless to say, there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the Budget will have on Mr Brown's own ambitions to replace Mr Blair as prime minister at some point after a third win.But Mr Brown will stun Westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put a smile on voters' faces and make them more inclined to back Labour in the election.But probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years.", "- Increase in the stamp duty threshold from \u00a360,000 - A freeze on petrol duty - An extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families - Possible help for pensioners The stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos.The chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from \u00a360,000.The Tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin branding stamp duty a \"classic Labour stealth tax\".Tax credits As a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take.Since then, average UK property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased.For the Lib Dems David Laws said: \"The chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,\" he said.The Liberal Democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to \u00a3150,000 in February.\"If Labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the Budget after the election, of the order of around \u00a310bn.\"", "Labour may have abolished hunting - but that didn't stop Chancellor Gordon Brown using his Budget to fire both barrels at some of the opposition parties' core election foxes.And in Labour circles there will undoubtedly be an argument over just how good a prime minister Gordon Brown will make at some point after the next election.He did it most obviously with his increase in national insurance contributions after the 2001 election campaign during which he had pledged not to increase income tax.As always, they accused him of glossing over the facts of the \"black hole\" at the centre of his finances which, they claim, would ensure tax increases after the election.Labour MPs, for example, will undoubtedly now engage in a debate over exactly how redistributive - a lovely Old Labour word - this chancellor really is.So if you are a couple with children, a pensioner, a patient or a youngster, there was something pulled from Mr Brown's red box in an attempt to persuade you to stick with or switch to a New Labour government.Tory leader Michael Howard said the chancellor was up to his old trick of deliberately re-casting his forecasts to give the illusion that everything in the Treasury larder is as fresh as the day it was first stored away for future use.Specifically, it saw him attempting to slaughter the council tax as an election issue and to tear limb from limb their wider policies for pensioners and families.", "Mr Kennedy added his party's priorities of free long-term care for the elderly, abolishing top-up fees and replacing the council tax would be funded by charging 50% income tax to those earning more than \u00a3100,000 per annum.The new \u00a3200 council tax rebate for pensioners did nothing to fix the \"unfair tax\", he added.The Lib Dem plan for a local income tax would benefit the typical household by more than \u00a3450 a year, with half of all pensioners paying no local tax and about three million being better off.On pensions, Mr Kennedy said it was a \"scandal\" that the system discriminated against women who had missed making National Insurance payments when they were having children.Gordon Brown has failed to tackle the \"fundamental unfairness\" in the tax system in his ninth Budget, Charles Kennedy has said.He contrasted his approach with Mr Brown's pledge in 2001 not to increase income tax.Speaking in the Commons after Mr Brown had delivered what is widely thought to be the last Budget before the general election, Mr Kennedy acknowledged that the UK was one of the most successful economies in the world.", "The simple fact was that under a new Labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole, Mr Howard said.Mr Brown's Budget was not about what was good for the country, but \"all about the interests of the Labour party,\" the Tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign.Mr Brown's council tax rebate for pensioners was \u00a3300 less than what the Tories were offering, Mr Howard said.People would face a \"clear choice\" at the election, either \"more waste and higher taxes under Labour or lower taxes and value for money with the Conservatives\", he said.Mr Brown liked to rattle off \"magical balances conjured out of thin air\" in a bid to convince people there was no \"black hole\" in the nation's finances, the Tory leader said.Everyone could see the chancellor's \"sweeteners\", but these hid tax rises for hard working families, he said.Labour's \"faltering election campaign\" would not be helped by the package of measures, Mr Howard added.\"Their only answer is to tax, to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later.\"", "In his Budget statement, the chancellor said the first 12,500 civil service jobs had been cut, on target.Unions oppose the plans but Mr Brown said \u00a32bn savings had already been made and more jobs had been cut than had been expected at this stage.Chancellor Gordon Brown said 12,500 jobs had gone while 7,800 were being moved out of the South East.Thousands of civil service jobs have already been cut or moved out of London as part of a major cost-cutting drive.Mark Serwotka, the leader of the Public and Commercial Services Union said: \"In last year's budget we had the day of the long knifes as the chancellor kicked off the crude game of who could cut the most civil service jobs between the government and the Tories.A further 200 jobs at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have been earmarked to be cut.", "But Aid charity Actionaid criticised Mr Brown's preoccupation with finding a vaccine and called on G8 nations to fund HIV/Aids treatments.Doubling the \u00a3400m being spent yearly on finding such a vaccine could advance it by three years and save six million lives, Mr Brown said on Thursday.Currently the private sector was only spending \u00a360m a year on seeking an inoculation and the market needed boosting, Mr Brown said.Mr Brown also said he had agreed with the Italian finance minister Domenico Siniscalco to push forward with plans for the world-wide sharing and co-ordination of research into the disease.Gordon Brown has called on rich nations to fund a \u00a35.5bn ($10bn) plan to fight the Aids epidemic and find a vaccine.The charity's head of HIV/Aids in Britain, Simon Wright said: \"While encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to discover an HIV vaccine is important, a failure to provide any funding for HIV treatments condemns a generation of people to death.\"I believe that the generation that provided the finance to combat, cure and eradicate the world's deadliest disease of today - and today the world's least curable disease - HIV/Aids - will rightly earn the title 'the great generation',\" Mr Brown said in a speech during his African tour.\"The UK's proposal for an International Finance Facility is so important - increasing world aid flows by over $50 billion (\u00a327bn).\"At least $10 billion per annum (\u00a35.5bn) is needed to address the HIV/Aids crisis in

election will give Britain the chance to change.\"Mr Blair has failed to tackle these problems, he claimed, saying he has the \"wrong solution\" to them.\"Let us never forget that when Michael Howard was in government Britain suffered mass unemployment, 15% interest rates, record home repossessions, and the introduction of the poll tax.\"Britain is heading in the wrong direction\", the Conservative leader said in his New Year message.\"With Labour Britain is working.The catastrophe was overshadowing the hopes for the future at this usually positive time of the year, Mr Howard said.This is the record Mr Blair will have to defend in the coming months, he said, urging voters to hold him to account.\"Worst of all, it is a government that has wasted people's money and failed to tackle the problems families face today.\"The last week has shown that the warm, caring heart of Britain beats as strong as ever.\"But Labour spokesman Mr Kemp said: \"It would be more appropriate for this message to come out on 1 April, not 1 January.\"", "The government must act quickly on the Law Lords' ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial is unlawful, Mary Robinson has

to executive detention and it was discriminatory because it didn't apply to British citizens,\" she said.Mrs Robinson said the Law Lords' ruling was \"in line with international legal opinion\" and praised their \"very decisive\" eight to one majority.The Law Lords said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions \"in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status\".\"It would be very troubling if the government did not accept the judgement and then work within it,\" she said.Mrs Robinson warned that a lack of action by the British government could lead to further action in legal arenas such as the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.", "\"We do not underestimate the scale of the

plans to airports throughout the country.The judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at Heathrow, Stansted and Luton airports.HACAN chairman John Stewart said: \"Almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation White Paper with much fanfare.At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to

short-term response to the high levels of passengers travelling from Prague who are subsequently found to be ineligible for entry to the UK.\"Lady Hale said immigration officers should have treated all would-be passengers in the same way, only using more intrusive questioning if there was a specific reason.Civil rights group Liberty said it exposed \"racism at the heart of the government's

serious effect on my business.A minimum wage just makes people complacent.Although I would not deny people the minimum wage increase, its timing stinks.I thank Mr. Blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage.The minimum wage will rise in October, benefiting more than 1m people, the government has announced.I don't believe in the minimum wage at all!This is great news, but that might be because I work for minimum wage.Hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level, and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard, but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own.The other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase, thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses  It is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage - this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the \"lower status\" jobs.I think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them.The Trade Unions Congress welcomed the increase, but has called for a \u00a36 minimum wage by next year.The government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage.If the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the \u00a36.00 mark there will be 12 more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt - namely mine.I currently employ 42 staff whose wages mirror the national minimum wage.According to the commission, many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage \"challenging\".We must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad.However for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage I would simply ask them: \"Would you be happy to work for less than \u00a35.05 an hour?\".I can't believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage!As an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional \u00a35000 per year.Our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the US minimum wage, yet our economy per person is only 2/3rds of the US!By increasing overheads, for business, there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt, or that pair of trainers for next to nothing.The recommendations came from the Low Pay Commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999.Still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it.I might add, that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation, people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wages.We all remember Michael Howard's protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced - funny how he's gone quiet on that one!In answer to Emma from Sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end... on the contrary Mr Blair wins - he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher Employer NI Contributions as well.Unveiling the latest increase, Mr Blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a \"symbol of decency and fairness\".Conservative leader Michael Howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not \"seek to disturb\" the increase.How many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirement?Although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential.The government says most of those on the minimum wage are women - with many working in cleaning, catering, shops and hairdressing.A \u00a33 per hour minimum wage was introduced last October for 16 to 17-year-olds, but apprentices are exempt.I work at a large Hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services - domestic, catering & portering etc - pay the minimum wage of \u00a34.85 as the basic rate.Andrew in Derby complains that raising the minimum wage is 'blatant electioneering'.The minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a worker's relationship with their employer.With the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removed.We can't afford not to pay a decent wage.As an employee for a small nursery, I know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer, who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last October's increase for the lower paid employees - who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimum.But the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) called for a \"pause year\" to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in October.Its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand out.I hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that Mr Blair and Mr Brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won't take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping, or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door?This was only 2 years ago and I was getting paid \u00a32.75 an hour, and working as hard as any of the older staff, maybe it's about time 16 - 21 year olds got a fair wage!Also I personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you?I am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level, but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers.In the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay, for example a job I did in Plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in Exeter by 75p an hour.The national minimum wage is currently set at \u00a34.85 per hour for those aged 22 and above, and at \u00a34.10 for those aged 18 to 21.If your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it's not being run properly and if it folds, a better-run company will take over its duties and employ more people, so everybody wins except incompetent business owners!The Liberal Democrats' economics spokesman Vincent Cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage.I think if any job is worth doing then it's worth being paid a fair wage for, and \u00a35.05 is hardly a fortune.I feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase, on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people can't afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life.If the rate rises to \u00a36 then I can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees.For too long wages were a point of exploitation - what could an employer get away with.I have my GCSE's A-Levels and A degree and have chosen to work for a small business that can't afford the wages I should be getting, I should be on at least 3x what I'm getting but they can't afford it.In very simplistic terms this put a pressure to keep low-paid wages low.Great keep at it Tony, I remember the despair of the 80s and the low wages employers got away with.Businesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay, shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firm.While I'm delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward, I am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses.We are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us.", "In July 1999 they asked 801 adults if they supported the ban for the Mail on Sunday.The Mail on Sunday survey found that

chest x-ray and further tests if appropriate.People coming to Britain for less than six months would not be medically tested unless they intended to work in health care, childcare or teaching.People would have to prove they have an acceptable standard of health and are unlikely to be a danger to public health in the UK, or impose significant costs or demands on the NHS.Home Office Minister Des Browne says the Government already routinely checks people for TB if they come into the UK for six months or more from high-risk countries.The Tories say people fleeing persecution will not be denied sanctuary in Britain because of poor health.Under 16s would not face tests for hepatitis and HIV.Children and pregnant women wanting to live in Britain permanently would not have to have a chest X-ray for TB.Here's a guide to the plan:  People coming to live and work in Britain from outside the EU.A positive test for TB would automatically mean visa applications being turned down.This says health screening for TB will be targeted on applicants from high-risk areas before they are given entry clearance.Those who are diagnosed with the disease would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK.They claim government figures show that TB in England has increased by 25% over the last 10 years and that nearly two-thirds of people with the disease were born overseas.", "Security, stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the UK took over the chairmanship of the EU in July, said Mr Straw.Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram told MPs a new White Paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the EU constitution.He said the UK was trying to ensure future EU budgets were limited to 1% of Europe's economic output and were spent \"where it adds most value\".Mr Straw used Thursday's Commons debate to launch the new White Paper on the prospects for the EU in 2005.The Tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the EU constitution would make Europe easier to understand.EU cooperation would help get better UK immigration controls, he argued.The Electoral Commission on Thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand.Mr Straw said no decisions had been taken - Chinese human rights had improved but not by enough.For the Liberal Democrats, Sir Menzies Campbell said the UK should not ignore the need to reform the EU Common Agricultural Policy.Mr Straw promised to continue to ensure the UK's budget rebate, secured in 1984 by Margaret Thatcher, was \"fully justified\".Mr Straw argued cooperation with European partners could bring a \"level playing field\" on immigration and asylum controls.", "British citizens are being included in the changes after the law lords said the current powers were discriminatory because they could only be used on foreign suspects.He said intercept evidence was only a small part of the case against the men and some of it could not be used because it could put sources' lives at risk.Under the proposed changes - prompted by the House of Lords ruling - the home secretary could order British citizens or foreign suspects who could not be deported, to face house arrest or other measures such as restrictions on their movements or limits on their use of telephones and the internet.He said the standard of proof for the new powers would have to be \"very high indeed\" and he asked whether ministers had looked at measures which fitted with human rights laws.The Law Society dubbed Mr Clarke's new proposals an \"abuse of power\".It comes after law lords ruled that the detention of 12 foreign terror suspects without trial breached human rights.UK citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism could face house arrest as part of a series of new measures outlined by the home secretary.There have been calls for the rules for wire-tap and intercept evidence to be allowed to be used in courts but Mr Clarke refused to back that change.Mr Clarke said prosecutions were the government's first preference and promised the powers would only be used in \"serious\" cases, with independent scrutiny from judges.He suggested changing the law to let security-cleared judges view evidence gathered by phone-tapping could allow more terror cases to come to court.Mr Clarke also said intelligence reports showed some British nationals were now playing a more significant role in terror threats.", "Mr Brown welcomed news that the Bill Gates Foundation and Norway are joining up to put an extra \u00a30.53bn ($1bn ) into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi).UK Chancellor Gordon Brown has offered \u00a3960m ($1.8bn) over 15 years to an international scheme aiming to boost vaccination and immunisation schemes.If Gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra \u00a34bn ($7.4bn) over 10 years, then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter, Mr Brown argued.\"As long as Mr Blair and Mr Brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries, more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty, not lifted out of it.\"Britain, France, Gavi and the Gates Foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the International Finance Facility (IFF) to the area of immunisation.Campaign groups including Friends of the Earth, the World Development Movement, and War on Want said UK government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty.", "Mr Straw, visiting Beijing, noted arms embargoes applied to China, Burma and Zimbabwe but not to North Korea, which he said had a terrible rights record.But Mr Straw insisted the EU's code of conduct on arms exports meant tough criteria on human rights still had to be met if the embargo was lifted.\"The result of any decision [to lift the arms embargo] should not be an increase in arms exports from European Union member states to China, either in quantitative or qualitative terms,\" Mr Straw said.The French want the embargo lifted because they want to sell arms to China; the Chinese want it lifted because they want to buy arms and battlefield technology from Europe.\"UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has defended plans to end the European Union's arms embargo on China, despite opposition from the US and Japan.He said Mr Straw was \"naive beyond belief\" if he accepted China's claim it does not want the ban lifted in order to buy weapons.China has in the past said it sees the weapons ban as politically driven, and does not want it lifted in order to buy more weapons.Washington has also voiced concern that the human rights conditions in China have not improved enough to merit an end to the embargo.Washington argues that if the embargo is lifted, it could lead to a buying spree for arms that China could use to threaten its diplomatic rival Taiwan.", "The Tories said they would not cut spending but agreed public spending would increase more slowly under their plans - leading to a total of \u00a333.5bn less spending than that anticipated by Labour by 2011.Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin also predicted Mr Brown would have to raise taxes by \u00a310bn or \u00a311bn if Labour was re-elected because he was borrowing and spending too much.And he claimed the Tories would cut \u00a335bn from public services, which was the equivalent of sacking every doctor and teacher in the UK.Mr Cable said taxation as a share of the economy would go up under all three of the main parties.Tory chairman Liam Fox accused Labour of \"at best misrepresentation at worst a downright lie\" and said the \"smear\" tactics were a sign of desperation.Labour and the Tories have clashed over tax and spending plans as the row over Gordon Brown's Budget turned into a full scale pre-election battle.The Lib Dems accused Mr Brown of ducking the issue of council tax rises.For the Lib Dems, Vince Cable said the chancellor had failed to deal with the \"looming problems\" of revaluation of council tax bands which he argued would result in \"massive increases\" for some.", "Elderly and disabled people would choose how their own budget for personal care was spent and organised under government plans.The Tories say people who pay for three years' long-term care directly or through insurance should be guaranteed free care for the rest of their lives.They also want to set up a new \"half-way house\" where social workers tell people how much money is available for their care and help them choose how to spend that \"individual budget\".Ministers say elderly and disabled people themselves, not social workers, should be able to decide on their care and stay in their own homes.There are 1.7m people needing care in England and ministers suggest the number could quadruple by 2050.But the government shunned opponents' calls for free long-term care.But Age Concern argued social care was chronically under-funded and older people were being offered choice in principle, but not in practice.And Tony Hunter, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said the plans could improve dignity and well-being for thousands of people.The Lib Dems say they would fund free personal care by a new 50% tax rate on incomes over \u00a3100,000.He ruled out free personal care in England - which is on offer in Scotland and Wales, saying it was \"unsustainable\".", "\"The conditions for euro entry are unchanged by this new decision about the stability and growth pact,\" Mr. Brown said.The chancellor said that the EU's planned changes in the growth and stability pact - designed to ensure that countries in the euro zone do not borrow too much - would force Britain to run a budget surplus of 1% over the economic cycle.But, speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, Gordon Brown said that the new stability pact rules were not part of a binding Treaty and could be changed again the future - potentially opening the way for future euro membership.Under Mr Brown's \"sustainable investment\" rule, government debt should be under 40% - in contrast to the 60% allowed under the growth and stability pact.Mr Brown said that it was vital the UK continued to invest in infrastructure, science, and education in the future.But the chancellor said Mr Fallon was \"impugning the integrity\" of the Office of National Statistics and said the decision had been made completely independently.Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Clarke said political give and take would replace more \"rigid\" rules.Under Mr Brown's rules, the UK current budget must be in balance over the economic cycle, but public investment is not counted as part of that deficit.Conservative Michael Fallon asked Mr Brown whether the Treasury had leaned on ONS to make this change, and said that the ONS had received a written paper from the Treasury on this matter.", "Curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied, Lord Falconer said.\"We would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand, you know what the minimum access is.Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court.Jim Parton, from Families Need Fathers, said the new proposals \"lacked compulsion\".Other plans include:  - Parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements, based on real-life examples that have worked in the past - Extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases - Better access to legal, emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet - Legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes.Between 15,000 and 20,000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year, although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention.She said a Conservative government would bring a \"radical reform\" of the family courts, as well as enforcing a \"legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation\".Theresa May, shadow secretary for the family, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government's plans were \"inadequate\" and were \"papering over the cracks of the current system\".Parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers.Judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a \"nuclear option\" which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child's interests, a spokesman said.John Ison, from the controversial group Fathers 4 Justice, said: \"It is very disappointing.", "It could cost \u00a380m to run a UK referendum on the European constitution, ministers have revealed.Mr Leslie said the cost could not be compared with the only previous British referendum, held 30 years ago.In a written parliamentary answer, Constitutional Affairs Minister Chris Leslie said the poll was likely to cost the same as a general election.But he said it would have been better to have rejected the constitution so avoiding the need for a referendum.", "Mr Brown has signed a debt relief deal with Tanzania which could cost the UK \u00a31 billion.On top of the relief deal with Tanzania Mr Brown said the UK would make similar offers to 70 poorer nations around the world.The days of Britain having to apologise for its colonial past are over, Gordon Brown has said.The UK has already cancelled its bilateral debts - money the UK alone is owed - with the world's poorest nations including Tanzania.Mr Brown said that missionairies had come to Africa because of their sense of duty.Mr Brown, on a week-long tour of Africa, spent two days in Tanzania before heading on Friday evening to Mozambique, a country where more than half of the 17-million population lives below the poverty line.\"We make this offer unilaterally but we are now asking other countries to join us,\" the chancellor said.", "But divorces are by no means the only documents in the archives which hold personal details of people often far removed from politics and Parliament.Divorce by Parliament was an expensive process open really only to the rich but the records also include the testimony of maids, butlers and coachmen about their masters and mistresses.Until 1857, the only way in England to get a full divorce which allowed re-marriage was to obtain an Act of Parliament by proving adultery or life-threatening cruelty.The archives do, of course, hold records of high (and low) politics too for both Houses of Parliament, including copies of all acts passed since 1497 - the oldest dealing with the employment of workers in the woollen industry in Norfolk.Among the records is the story of Jane Campbell, the first woman ever to divorce her husband.As well as making divorce history, Jane Campbell won custody of her children - unusual for a woman at the time.Mr Prior sees the changes as part of a wider revolution in archives generally.The legacy is pages of testimonies used in the hearings, dating back to 1670, all recorded among the 325,000 items which fill the 12 floors of the parliamentary archives in Parliament's Victoria Tower.Few realise that Westminster in effect has its own divorce den.This wealth of material has long been open to the public at the House of Lords Record Office, with visitors able to phone ahead when they want to view particular items in the search room.There are details of foreign nationals made British citizens by act of Parliament, including composer George Frideric Handel in 1727.For sprinkled among 12 floors of archives are blow-by-blow accounts of marital break-ups - and now you can search what's there online.That document is likely to feature in the exhibition the archives will put on next year as part of a series of events across London to mark the 400th anniversary of Guy Fawkes' conspiracy.", "Party election supremo Alan Milburn said the apparent drop in average incomes was because self-employed people had been affected by a \"world downturn\" which hit their profits.Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said: \"We have fought a very positive campaign.The Foreign Secretary told the BBC: \"I was making the observation that because of Michael Howard's impetuosity you can get lurches of policy.\"In a speech to the Foreign Policy Centre Mr Straw said of the Tory leader: \"He is clever, fluent and tactical, but he is not wise.Britain's economic future will be at the heart of Labour's poll campaign, Chancellor Gordon Brown has said.I think he will want to look quite carefully at what Jack Straw said about Michael Howard.\"Mr Brown also dismissed the figures insisting that the \"typical family\" has been much better off under Labour.He said they should concentrate instead on issues such as the environment, international development and the arms trade, family policy, and the reform of the criminal justice system.", "And it looked like the Labour campaign - which was already being criticised for being thrown into defensive mode by Mr Howard on issues such as immigration and health - was on the rocks.During the phoney campaign, Labour got into trouble over its central claim that Michael Howard was planning \u00a335 bn cuts in public services.He was sacked for his gaffe, but the damage had been done and the faltering Labour campaign was back on track.Then deputy Conservative Chairman Howard Flight was reported to have suggested Mr Howard was secretly planning even bigger \"cuts\".The date has been pencilled into the diaries of politicians and political journalists for many months and, despite occasional panics that the prime minister was on the verge of calling a snap poll, it has not shifted.And it is certain one of the big arguments at the centre of the election battle will be around the big parties' tax and spend policies.A second central argument will be over taxation, with the Tories claiming the Chancellor has to fill a black hole at the centre of his finances and will be forced to raise taxes if Labour wins again.The prime minister and his campaign boss Alan Milburn have already insisted the election will be fought on the economy and what they claim is a stark choice between Labour's stability and investment against Tory cuts and boom and bust.", "The information commissioner is to look into a complaint from the Lib Dems about how Labour uses its call centres.A party official said there was only scattered evidence of the Tories breaking the rules but people had complained every day about Labour.The Lib Dems say Labour is telephoning people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing calls.His letter to the commissioner quotes from a Labour Party handbook about \"identifying target voters\".\"For example, we could send the target (Conservative) people a letter from someone who had defected from the Tories to Labour explaining the reasons why voting Tory is a bad idea or we could send Labour (weak) people a letter encouraging them to sign up for a postal vote.\"And it quotes a Stevenage Labour Party members' newsletter explaining how voters will be telephoned about their voting intentions.Labour

avoids those on TPS lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising but not when making \"voter identification\" calls.Mr Taylor tells the commissioner: \"It is clear beyond peradventure

Labour spokesman told BBC News: \"We expect the information commissioner to take any complaint seriously.\"As the information commissioner himself has said, if people are not marketing something, if

said that despite their political differences, he and Lord Callaghan became friends.Lord Callaghan, who leaves a son and two daughters, was the longest living former British PM in history.When Britain

claiming voters had a \"fundamental lack of trust in the prime minister\".Eight out of 10 voters do not trust politicians to tell the truth, a new poll conducted for the BBC suggests.The poll comes after Foreign Secretary Jack Straw predicted trust would be \"the key choice\" at the next election.The Conservatives are keen to highlight the trust issue.Former education secretary Estelle Morris told BBC News 24 that there was a \"real problem of trust\" between the public and the politicians.The poll also looked at what lay behind the lack of trust in politicians.Mr Straw told activists in

Mr Brown and Mr Blair remain relatively modest.Amid all this it is easy to forget that Mr Brown remains the man most likely to succeed Mr Blair as Labour leader.How much longer Mr Brown will continue in the job is not clear (he once said there are two types of chancellor: \"those who fail and those who get out in time.\")But, for now, Mr Brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors - or politicians - before him.Mr Blair, for his part, is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful Mr Brown, who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his Budget until the last possible minute.The other part of the deal, that Mr Blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor, is the stuff of Westminster legend.And Mr Blair's decision to name his own retirement date has at least given Mr Brown something to aim for - even if the prime minister's intention to \"serve a full third term\" if elected, took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters.There may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown - including Mr Milburn - but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that Mr Brown can.But if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in 1994, Mr Brown continued his devotion to politics.The chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the NHS and is seen as being more \"Old Labour\" than Mr Blair in his approach to wealth redistribution.A truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by Blairite Alan Milburn being brought in over the head of Mr Brown to run the election campaign.If that was true then, Mr Brown, who married PR executive Sarah Macaulay in 2000, changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in 2002.Within four years, Mr Brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.But with the Tories having appeared to get the better of the pre-election campaign thus far there are reports that Mr Brown - using the Budget as a springboard - is to revitalise Labour's campaign.This dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by Mr Brown's former girlfriend of five years, Princess Marguerite of Romania, the eldest daughter of ex-King Michael of Romania, who said a relationship with him was \"politics, politics, politics\".", "Mr Boateng, 53, is to become the UK's high commissioner to South Africa.\"Mr Blair's appointment of Paul Boateng is the latest example of a worrying trend of failed Tony's cronies being appointed to senior diplomatic posts,\" he said.Mr Boateng said: \"I am honoured to be asked to take on this role, especially as it comes at such an integral time for our relationship with South Africa and the African continent.Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said that, if in government, he would

and a trusted friend for many years.\"I congratulate Paul on his new appointment.Paul Boateng, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is to step down as a Labour MP at the forthcoming general election.Mr Boateng also laughed off suggestions that his re-election in Brent South seat had been in danger saying it was \"one of the safest Labour seats in the country\".", "\"Something tells me that someone, somewhere out there is just a little bit rattled,\" Mr Howard said.In reference to the appearance of Mr Howard's family on the conference stage with him, Mr Milburn said: \"Michael Howard is perfectly entitled to pose with his family today.Michael Howard has said a claim by Peter Hain that the Tory leader is acting like an \"attack mongrel\" shows Labour is \"rattled\" by the opposition.Mr Hain, Leader of the Commons, told BBC Radio Four's Today programme that Mr Howard's stance on the government's anti-terrorism legislation was putting the country at risk.Labour election co-ordinator Alan Milburn said: \"Michael Howard's speech today confirms what we have always said - that his only strategy is opportunism but he has no forward vision for the country.Mr Howard said his party plans for immigration quotas, which have also been the focus of much media coverage, were not \"racist\" - just \"common sense\".Mr Howard said Tory policies on schools, taxes, immigration and crime were striking a chord with voters.Mr Howard told his party that Labour would \"do anything, say anything, claim anything to cling on to office at all costs\".Mr Hain made the claim about Tory tactics in the anti-terror bill debate.Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett rejected Mr Howard's comment, telling Radio 4's PM programme that Labour was not \"rattled\".\"Since the beginning of this year - election year - we've been making the political weather,\" he told the party conference.Mr Howard denied he had been \"playing politics\" by raising the case of Margaret Dixon, whose operation had been cancelled seven times, which grabbed headlines for the party two weeks ago.", "Tory co-chairman Liam Fox has opened proceedings with a speech criticising Tony Blair's record in government.Conservative leader Michael Howard, who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on Friday, will address them in a lunchtime speech.He also attacked the government's \"failure\" to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the NHS, telling delegates Labour cannot be trusted on education or crime.Mr Howard is likely to defend his party's handling of the bill, which was only passed after the Conservatives accepted Prime Minister Tony Blair's promise that MPs would be able to review it within a year.Tory delegates are gathering for what is expected to be their last conference before the general election, declaring Britain needs \"a change at the top\".", "Mr Sayeed has been MP for Mid-Bedfordshire since 1997.But his constituency association voted against a move to deselect him, with Mr Sayeed winning 173 of the 299 votes.After the vote, Mr Sayeed said only a fifth of association members had voted against him and he intended to get on with winning the election.Mr Sayeed had denied the claims, saying the suspension was \"unjust and wrong\" but he made an \"unreserved\" apology to MPs in the Commons chamber.Mr Sayeed was suspended from Parliament for two weeks last month after the Commons standards and privileges committee said his conduct had fallen \"well below the standards expected\".The Standards and Privileges Committee inquiry was launched after the Sunday Times alleged English Manner Limited charged clients for access to Westminster through Mr Sayeed.", "Mr Howard claimed, with some justification, that the Tories' campaign has got off to a \"great start\".But as they gear up for the start of the campaign proper, the party at least has reason to hope that, like his Australian namesake, Mr Howard really isn't finished yet.But Mr Howard's overall message - that the Tories have Labour on the run and that they can win the next election - did not sound quite as hollow as it might have done six months ago.They have had Labour on the back foot over immigration, with Tony Blair hastily adding a sixth promise on the issue to his latest pledge card, and have even managed to score points in traditional Labour territory such as health and education.Some delegates even spoke of the next election being like 1970, when Ted Heath, behind in the polls and written off by the pundits, snatched victory from Harold Wilson's Labour Party.Michael Howard had already broken away from the printed text of his speech, at his party's spring conference in Brighton, to deliver a smart rebuff to Peter Hain's description of him as an \"attack mongrel\", claiming such personal abuse meant Labour was \"rattled\" by the Tory challenge.And here he was again, moving to the front of the stage as the party faithful rose to their feet in applause, to make a personal, ad-libbed appeal to them to go out and fight for victory.The audience's reaction to all of this was a little muted by party conference standards.Mr Howard was also joined on stage by his wife Sandra, daughter Larissa and stepson Sholto.Much of the credit for the Tories' recent change of fortune must go to Lynton Crosby, the Australian strategist who succeeded in turning political veteran and apparent no-hoper John Howard, of Australia's Liberal Party, into a serial election winner.\"It was very disappointing.\"I always know where I am with him because all my life he has meant what he has said to me,\" he said.They all insisted it was not going to be a re-run of 2001.The Peter Hain \"mongrel\" attack, he says, is just the latest example of the party getting the tone wrong - a by-product, he claims, of the Tories setting the agenda.Even allowing for the natural bias against the Tories in some opinion polls, they are still behind, when to have a chance of overturning Labour's whopping majority, they should really be ahead.Oliver Letwin, one of the men lampooned in the Labour poster, affects bewilderment at what he believes is Labour's loss of its once sure footing on the campaign trail.", "There will also be elections for local councils and mayors in parts of England on 5 May.People in England, Scotland and Wales must have registered by 1700 GMT to be able to vote in the general election if it is held, as expected, on 5 May.Last week Preston City Council reported that more than 14,000 of its voters were not registered.\"If you want your voice to be heard on 5 May you will need to have registered by Friday 11 March.\"Those who filled in forms last autumn should already be on the register - but those who have moved house or were on holiday may have been left off.", "Science Minister Lord Sainsbury has made a \u00a32m donation to the Labour Party for its General Election fund.Lord Sainsbury added: \"I am pleased to be able to make this contribution to the general election funds of the Labour Party because I believe that they are the only party that has the vision to deliver both economic prosperity and better public services for Britain.\"David Sainsbury said he was pleased to give cash to a party that had the \"vision\" to deliver economic prosperity and better public services for Britain.The 64-year-old latest donation follows a \u00a32.5m gift to the party in 2003.", "The prime minister said he was \"up for it\" as the country waits to go to the polls, possibly in a matter of weeks.Whether he still had something to offer, he said, was a judgement for people to make.Speaking amid a flurry of pre-election campaigning, the prime minister said: \"I am an issue, I always will be.He said Britain was in danger of needless panic over public safety issues.Mr Blair said the government was also looking at \"how to make sure that legal aid is not abused with actions against doctors and others\", as part of a review being carried out by the Lord Chancellor's Department.Asked if he would quit as leader if he felt like a liability to Labour, he said: \"It's important always not to do the job unless you feel you have something to contribute.\"He told The Observer government life was a \"constant barrage of attack\" but said he would not stay in charge if he felt unable to contribute.Mr Blair said he had learned from a series of at times tough encounters with members of the public, during question and answer sessions across the country in recent weeks.Mr Blair also spoke of meeting many people across the country with concerns about the compensation culture.", "A Labour party spokesman played down differences with Mr Wyatt and said Mr Brown already had a prominent campaign role.Labour said the economy was at the heart of the campaign and Mr Brown therefore had a prominent role.However, Mr Wyatt predicted the campaign would get under way properly once the chancellor delivered his budget.The Conservatives have been \"a lot smarter\" in the way they have conducted the general election campaign, a Labour backbencher has said.But Mr Wyatt argued: \"By some way, he is currently the figure in all of the polls that people trust and see that has delivered over eight years an economy unmatched anywhere in the world.", "A Conservative spokesperson said: \"The Liberal Democrats can talk all they like about strategy.Mr Howard's seat is at the top of the Liberal Democrats' list.He said it was \"nothing personal\" but that \"very many of the prominent Conservatives\" had slender leads in seats where the Lib Dems were second.In 2001, Michael Howard won the Folkestone & Hythe seat with 20,645 votes, compared to 14,738 for the Liberal Democrat candidate Peter Carroll, giving the Tory leader a majority of 5,907.The problem the Liberal Democrats face is that a large number of Lib Dem voters do not agree with their policies.The Liberal Democrats are aiming to unseat a string of top Tories - including leader Michael Howard - at the next general election.", "\"What people needed was ... a party which was listening to their concerns; a party which was prepared to stand up and say so; a party which said no to the prime minister.\"On Saturday, the Lib Dem chief executive said it was \"just a cock-up\" that Mr Kennedy and his colleagues missed the vote, which the government won by a majority of only 14.Mr Kennedy said: \"Britain is the fourth-largest economy in the world.He said he was certain MPs would get another chance to vote against the plans.Speaking in Harrogate Mr Kennedy said: \"People want a credible, principled political party which offers a different vision of what Britain can be.\"\"We go into the election as an independent party and we come out as an independent party,\" he said.Unveiling the slogan at the party's spring conference, he said there was no \"glass ceiling\" to its ambitions.Earlier, Mr Kennedy told Radio 4's Today programme there was no possibility of forming a coalition with Labour in the event of a hung Parliament.The Liberal Democrats will present themselves as \"the real alternative\" in the forthcoming general election campaign, Charles Kennedy has said.Your vote was wasted."], "extra": [{"money": 6, "medical_emergency": 1, "wealthy": 5, "banking": 6, "computer": 1,
